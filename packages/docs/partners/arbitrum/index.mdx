Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

## About Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs while maintaining Ethereum's security. Developed by Offchain Labs, it utilizes **optimistic rollup technology** to batch transactions off-chain before submitting them to Ethereum. Key products include:

- **Arbitrum One**: Mainnet for decentralized applications (dApps)
- **Arbitrum Orbit**: Permissionless framework for launching custom Layer 3 chains
- **Stylus**: Multi-language smart contract environment (Rust, C, C++)

As the largest Ethereum Layer 2 by Total Value Locked (TVL), Arbitrum hosts 500+ dApps and processes ~10x more transactions than Ethereum mainnet at &lt;1% of the cost. Its ecosystem spans DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and enterprise solutions.

## Technology

Arbitrum's core innovations include:

1. **Optimistic Rollups**: Batches transactions off-chain, assuming validity unless challenged via fraud proofs.
2. **Nitro Stack**: WASM-based virtual machine improving compatibility and performance.
3. **Multi-Round Fraud Proofs**: Enables trustless validation through interactive dispute resolution.
4. **EVM+ Compatibility**: Executes Ethereum contracts unmodified while adding custom precompiles.
5. **AnyTrust Channels**: Dedicated throughput with validator committees for enterprise use cases.

This architecture solves Ethereum's scalability trilemma by achieving 40,000 TPS while inheriting Ethereum's security. The **Arbitrum DAO** (governed by ARB token holders) oversees protocol upgrades and treasury management.

## Key Features

- **EVM+ Bytecode Compatibility**: Run Ethereum contracts without modifications
- **Sub-Cent Transaction Fees**: 90-95% cheaper than Layer 1 Ethereum
- **Stylus Multi-VM**: Deploy Rust/C++ contracts interoperable with Solidity
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Native bridge supporting ETH/ERC-20 transfers
- **Onchain Privacy**: Integration with ZK-proof systems via partnership with Aztec
- **Decentralized Sequencing**: MEV-resistant transaction ordering
- **Gasless Relays**: Meta-transactions sponsored by dApps

## Integration with Eliza

OS  
ElizaOS leverages Arbitrum's **MultiVM architecture** for AI agent deployment:

- **Stylus Integration**: AI agents execute Rust-based smart contracts natively [GitHub: @elizaos/plugin-evm](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins)
- **Onchain Actions**: Agents perform token swaps/transfers via prebuilt EVM plugin workflows
- **Funding Programs**: $1M+ Trailblazer grants for AI agent development on Arbitrum
- **ZK Co-Processor**: Collaborative Layer 3 with Zypher Network for verifiable AI inferences

Technical synergy enables:

- Real-time agent interactions with DeFi protocols
- RAG-enhanced transaction memory across Orbit chains
- Batch transaction processing via Nitro's compression engine
