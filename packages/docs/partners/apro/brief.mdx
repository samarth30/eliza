# APRO

APRO develops secure infrastructure for decentralized AI ecosystems, with its flagship **AgentText Transfer Protocol Secure (ATTPs)** enabling blockchain-powered, verifiable AI agent communication with cryptographic accountability.

**Core Products:**

- ATTPs protocol for AI agent interoperability
- Decentralized verification network using zero-knowledge proofs
- Staking infrastructure for node operators
- Enterprise blockchain integrations for AI workflows

**ElizaOS Integration:**

- ATTPs powers ElizaOS's agent communication backbone
- Implements four source agents: Data Validator, Trust Scorer, Proof Generator, Slashing Monitor
- Provides SDK for ZK-verified AI workflows
- Auto-generates Merkle inclusion proofs for agent decisions
- APRO nodes validate Eliza transactions with shared staking pool
- Enables cross-chain Ethereum/Solana AI agent interoperability

**Recent Developments:**

- 2025 Q1: ATTPs v2 with BNB Chain integration
- 2024 Q4: $3M seed round (Polychain, ABCDE Labs)
- 2024 Q3: Mainnet slashing with $18M TVL

**Market Position:**

- Outperforms Chainlink (2.1s vs 8.7s zk-proof latency, 56% lower gas costs)
- Partners: Mind Network (FHE privacy), Virtuals Protocol (GPU marketplace), Presto Labs
- Metrics: 420+ integrated AI agents, $23M protocol revenue, 89% node retention

**Roadmap:** FHE privacy pools (Q2 2025), cross-chain asset transfers (Q3), on-chain reputation system (Q4)
