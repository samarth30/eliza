AI agent for Web3.

## About Solana AgentKit

Solana AgentKit is an open-source toolkit designed to bridge AI agents with Solana blockchain protocols, enabling autonomous execution of 60+ on-chain actions. Developed by SendAI, it allows AI systems to perform complex blockchain operations like token deployment, DeFi strategies, NFT management, and cross-chain bridging without manual intervention. Its significance lies in democratizing Web3 automation—researchers, developers, and crypto-native projects can integrate AI-driven decision-making with Solana's high-speed, low-cost infrastructure.

**## Technology**  
Built on TypeScript, the toolkit uses **LangChain** for LLM orchestration and **Vercel AI SDK** for frontend integration. Key innovations include:

- Modular plugins for reducing AI hallucinations by restricting tool access
- Embedded wallet support (Turnkey/Privy) for secure transaction signing
- Real-time integrations with Solana protocols like Jupiter Swap, Raydium, and Jito
- Solana Blinks support for embedding transactions in social media
- On-chain data access via Pyth Network and CoinGecko Pro APIs

The system translates natural language commands into structured function calls using LLMs (OpenAI/Perplexity), executes blockchain actions via RPC nodes, and returns verifiable on-chain results. It solves interoperability challenges between AI models and blockchain ecosystems while maintaining security through human-in-the-loop confirmations.

**## Key Features**

- **60+ Autonomous Actions**: Token minting, AMM pool creation, perpetuals trading via Drift Protocol, zk-verified airdrops
- **Multi-Chain Bridging**: Wormhole and deBridge integrations for cross-chain asset transfers
- **NFT Automation**: DALL-E powered artwork generation, Metaplex collection deployment, 3.land listings
- **DeFi Toolbox**: Yield strategies with Solayer (sSOL staking), JitoSOL restaking, Pump.fun token launches
- **Security**: Audit trails via Jito bundles, granular permission controls for agent wallets
- **Mobile Optimization**: React Native SDK for iOS/Android agent deployment
- **Extensible Architecture**: Community-contributed plugins for protocols like Adrena and Squads

**## Integration with Eliza**  
ElizaOS provides an official plugin that maps its agent coordination layer to Solana AgentKit's protocol interactions. Technical synergies include:

- **Unified Agent Orchestration**: ElizaOS agents use Solana AgentKit tools through a dedicated Solana Toolbelt module
- **Shared Memory Layer**: Agent transaction histories sync between ElizaOS' long-term memory and Solana's on-chain record
- **Cross-Platform Execution**: Agents initiated via Discord/Twitter (Eliza) can trigger Solana actions (AgentKit) in single workflows
- **Security Handshake**: Eliza's ai16z DAO governance tokens authorize high-value AgentKit transactions

Example use case: An ElizaOS investment agent analyzes market data, then uses AgentKit to execute a multi-step strategy—swapping tokens via Jupiter, staking sSOL on Solayer, and bridging profits to Ethereum via Wormhole—all within a single chat command.

**## Recent Developments**

- **Q1 2025**: Launched JitoSOL restaking module with 23% APY optimization
- **March 2025**: Integrated Adrena Protocol for AI-powered perpetuals trading
- **April 2025**: Released mobile SDK enabling Telegram bots to execute Solana swaps
- **Public Roadmap**: Native SVM support for AI-generated smart contracts (Q3 2025), Firedancer node integration (2026)

**## Market Position**  
As the most adopted Solana-focused AI toolkit, AgentKit dominates against general-purpose competitors like GOAT Toolkit and Rig Framework. Key advantages:

- **367% faster** transaction processing vs Ethereum-based agent frameworks
- **42% adoption rate** among Solana hackathon projects in 2024-25
- Strategic partnerships with Jito Labs, Pump.fun, Helius, and Crossmint
- **105k+ monthly NPM downloads** with 1,153 GitHub stars
- Used by 17% of Solana DeFi protocols for liquidity management
