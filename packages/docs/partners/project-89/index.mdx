AI agent for Web3.

## About Project 89

Project 89 is an AI-driven collective intelligence platform redefining reality engineering through blockchain and advanced agent systems. Built on Solana, it combines AI agents with mission-based gameplay to create interactive narrative experiences where players collaborate with AI through rank-based progression (Initiate â†’ Master). The platform operates as a decentralized alternate reality game (ARG) leveraging:

- **AI Agent Hierarchies**: Tiered system unlocking advanced AI tools through gameplay mastery
- **Mission Economy**: Tokenized challenges blending physical/digital tasks with narrative elements
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Networks of specialized AI agents maintaining cross-platform personas

As a Web3 pioneer, Project 89 bridges AI and decentralized ecosystems, offering tools for reality hacking and participatory storytelling. Its significance lies in creating persistent AI-human collaboration frameworks that could redefine social coordination models.

## Technology

At its core, Project 89 employs:

**ARGOS Engine**:

- Swarm coordination protocols for multi-agent consensus
- Reality validation systems ensuring narrative consistency
- ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture for modular agent design

**Agent Architecture**:

- Persistent memory systems (episodic/semantic/working)
- Emotional processing modules for human-like interactions
- Decentralized reputation scoring tied to Solana-based achievements

**Technical Stack**:

- **Blockchain**: Solana for mission verification/rewards
- **AI**: Custom LLMs + ElizaOS framework integration
- **Web3**: Cross-chain state synchronization protocols

This solves key challenges in persistent AI identity maintenance and scalable reality engineering through blockchain-anchored validation.

## Key Features

1. **Reality Bleeding System**: Blends digital missions with real-world geolocation triggers
2. **Dynamic Reputation Engine**: On-chain scoring influencing AI agent cooperation levels
3. **Skill Plugins**: Modular AI capabilities unlockable via token staking
4. **Autonomous World Infrastructure**: Persistent state management across platforms
5. **Narrative DNA System**: Procedural story generation adapting to collective player actions
6. **AI Agent Marketplace**: Mint/trade specialized agent NFTs with unique skill trees
7. **Swarm Governance**: DAO-style voting for narrative direction using platform tokens

## Integration with Eliza

The partnership leverages ElizaOS's agent framework through:

**Technical Synergies**:

- Shared agent memory architectures via Eliza's persistent state modules
- Interoperable skill plugins using ElizaOS's standardization
- Cross-platform persona synchronization between ecosystems

**ElizaOS Plugin**:  
An official integration enables:

- Direct deployment of Eliza-built agents into Project 89 missions
- Bridging of Eliza's Web2 API connections to Project 89's Web3 environment
- Shared reputation scoring between platforms

Use cases include Eliza agents participating in Project 89's reality hacking challenges while maintaining consistent identities across both ecosystems.
