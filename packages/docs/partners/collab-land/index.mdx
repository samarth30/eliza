Token-gated communities.

## About Collab.Land

Collab.Land is a market-leading Web3 infrastructure provider specializing in automated token-gated community management. Founded in 2020, it serves over 43,000 tokenized communities across 40+ blockchains including Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. Their flagship product is an automated bot that enables token-based access control for Discord/Telegram communities, coupled with continuous membership verification. The platform introduced the $COLLAB ERC-20 governance token in 2023, establishing a decentralized ecosystem managed through Collab.Land DAO.

## Technology

Built on an EVM-compatible stack, Collab.Land's core innovation is Token-Gating Rules (TGRs) - smart logic that automatically assigns roles based on:

- **Balance checks**: Verifying ERC-20 token holdings
- **Attribute validation**: Analyzing NFT metadata traits (ERC-721/1155)

The system performs real-time wallet scans across 30+ supported wallets/WalletConnect, with automated role management through Discord/Telegram API integrations. Their admin dashboard (Command Center) enables granular permission settings while maintaining user privacy - verified addresses remain encrypted and never exposed to community admins.

## Key Features

- **Multi-chain token gating**: Supports 40+ L1/L2 networks
- **Dynamic role management**: Auto-updates permissions based on wallet changes
- **Developer SDK**: Enables custom token-gated web apps and API integrations
- **DAO governance**: $COLLAB token holders vote on platform upgrades
- **Enterprise admin tools**: Bulk member management and activity analytics
- **Miniapp ecosystem**: Extend functionality through modular Web3 applications
- **Military-grade security**: Non-custodial architecture with zero wallet access

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin repository exists, Collab.Land's REST APIs and JavaScript SDK enable deep integrations:

```javascript
// Example token gating implementation
const { verifyTokenOwnership } = require('@collabland/sdk');

async function checkAccess(walletAddress) {
  return await verifyTokenOwnership({
    chainId: 1,
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    wallet: walletAddress,
  });
}
```

Technical synergies include embedding Collab.Land's token verification directly into ElizaOS workflows, enabling:

- Native token-gated content access within Eliza interfaces
- Automated role synchronization between Discord/Eliza environments
- Joint governance models leveraging $COLLAB tokenholder input

## Recent Developments

- **2023 COLLAB token launch**: Distributed to 2M+ community members
- **EthCC 2024 participation**: Showcased AI-powered community management tools
- **Multi-wallet support expansion**: Added 15 new wallet integrations in 2024
- **Enterprise partnerships**: New collaborations with Adidas, Pudgy Penguins
