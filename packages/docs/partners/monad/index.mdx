High-performance Layer 1 blockchain.

## About Monad

Monad is an ultra-high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed to solve scalability challenges while maintaining decentralization and security. It combines full EVM bytecode compatibility with groundbreaking throughput of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), 1-second block times, and near-zero gas fees. Monad’s mission is to enable seamless portability for Ethereum developers while providing a scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and high-frequency use cases.

**Main Products/Services**:

- EVM-compatible smart contract platform
- Developer tools for Ethereum-native migrations
- High-performance consensus mechanism (MonadBFT)
- MonadDB, a state storage system optimized for parallel processing

**Significance**:  
Monad addresses the blockchain trilemma by offering a single-shard architecture that supports Ethereum’s ecosystem while outperforming competitors in speed and cost. Its EVM compatibility positions it as a natural successor for Ethereum developers seeking scalability without code changes.

## Technology

Monad’s architecture introduces four core innovations:

1. **Parallel Execution**:

   - Processes transactions concurrently using **optimistic parallelization**, assuming independence unless dependencies are detected.
   - Resolves conflicts through re-execution of dependent transactions.

2. **MonadBFT**:

   - A Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus protocol derived from HotStuff, enabling 1-second single-slot finality.
   - Separates consensus and execution phases (**asynchronous execution**) to maximize efficiency.

3. **MonadDB**:

   - A custom database storing blockchain state on SSDs (not RAM), reducing node hardware costs.
   - Enables parallel read/write operations for faster transaction processing.

4. **Superscalar Pipelining**:
   - Splits transaction processing into stages (fetching, decoding, executing) that run in parallel, akin to CPU optimizations.

**Problems Solved**:

- Eliminates Ethereum’s 15-30 TPS bottleneck.
- Reduces node operation costs, promoting decentralization.
- Maintains full Ethereum tooling compatibility (MetaMask, Etherscan) while scaling performance.

## Key Features

- **10,000 TPS**: Processes transactions 1,000x faster than Ethereum.
- **1-Second Finality**: Instant confirmation for high-frequency applications.
- **EVM Bytecode Compatibility**: No code changes needed for Ethereum dApps.
- **Near-Zero Fees**: Sub-$0.01 transaction costs at scale.
- **Low Hardware Requirements**: Nodes run on consumer-grade SSDs.
- **Deferred Execution**: Decouples consensus and execution for reduced latency.
- **Ethereum RPC Compatibility**: Supports existing wallets, oracles, and analytics tools.

## Integration with Eliza

Monad’s partnership with ElizaOS focuses on interoperability and user experience:

- **Direct Service Access**: ElizaOS users interact with Monad’s blockchain for transactions, smart contracts, and dApps natively.
- **High-Throughput Use Cases**: Enables ElizaOS to support demanding applications like real-time gaming or DeFi arbitrage.
- **Unified Tooling**: Developers use Monad’s EVM-compatible environment within ElizaOS workflows.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: While no official ElizaOS plugin is publicly documented, Monad’s RPC compatibility suggests seamless integration potential for wallet connectors, node interfaces, or cross-chain tools.

## Recent Developments

- **Chainlink Scale Partnership** (April 2025): Integrated decentralized oracle services for low-cost, secure data feeds.
- **Mainnet Launch Preparation**: On track for 2025 deployment, with testnet achieving 8,000+ TPS in stress tests.
- **Ecosystem Grants**: $50M allocated to developers building DeFi, NFT, and gaming projects.
- **Team Expansion**: Added 20+ engineers specializing in distributed systems and low-latency optimizations.

**Roadmap**:

- Expand validator set to 150+ nodes by EOY 2025.
- Introduce zk-SNARK-based privacy features.
- Enhance MonadDB’s compression algorithms for larger state storage.

## Market Position

**Competitors**:

- Outperforms Solana in EVM compatibility and Ethereum in speed.
- Competes with Avalanche and Polygon in scalability but offers superior finality and lower fees.

**Key Partnerships**:

- **Chainlink**: Oracle integration for DeFi.
- **Pyth Network**: Real-time price feeds.
- **Ether.fi**: Liquid staking solutions.

**Adoption**:

- 200+ dApps migrated from Ethereum during testnet phase.
- 40,000+ developer accounts active inMonad’s sandbox environment.
