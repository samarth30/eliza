Decentralized content entertainment platform.

## About Tron

Tron is a decentralized blockchain platform established in 2017 by Justin Sun, designed to revolutionize digital content distribution and entertainment. Its core mission is to eliminate intermediaries like YouTube and Spotify by enabling direct creator-to-audience interactions through blockchain technology. Key products/services include:

- **TRX cryptocurrency**: Native token for transactions, staking, and governance
- **Smart contracts**: Supports TRC-20 (Ethereum-compatible) and TRC-10 token standards
- **Decentralized applications (dApps)**: Hosts over 2,000 dApps spanning DeFi, gaming, and content-sharing
- **BitTorrent integration**: Acquired in 2018 to decentralize file-sharing  
  Significantly, Tron ranks among the top 3 blockchain networks by protocol revenue ($128.1M in Q4 2024) and handles ~2,000 transactions per second.

## Technology

### Stack & Innovations

- **Consensus**: Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) with 27 elected Super Representatives
- **Architecture**:
  - _Storage Layer_: Distributed blockchain data storage
  - _Core Layer_: Smart contract execution via Tron Virtual Machine (TVM)
  - _Application Layer_: dApp development tools and APIs
- **Throughput**: 2,000 TPS with $0.000005 average transaction fee
- **Interoperability**: EVM-compatible for seamless Ethereum dApp migration

Key technical differentiators:

- Zero-fee transactions for basic operations using bandwidth points
- Energy-efficient consensus (98% less energy than Bitcoin)
- Storage layer optimized for media-rich content
