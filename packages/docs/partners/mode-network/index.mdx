Layer 2 scaling solution.

## About Mode Network

Mode Network is an AI-optimized Layer 2 blockchain built using Optimism’s OP Stack, designed to scale decentralized finance (DeFi) through autonomous AI agents and onchain economic systems. As part of the Optimism Superchain ecosystem, it leverages shared security, liquidity, and interoperability with chains like Base and Zora. Mode’s primary mission is to create a decentralized ecosystem where developers and users are directly rewarded for contributing to network growth through mechanisms like sequencer fee sharing and referral incentives.

**Main Products/Services**:

- **DeFAI-powered L2 Infrastructure**: Hosts 50+ DeFi applications optimized for AI agents.
- **Native Perpetuals DEX**: Developed in partnership with Orderly Network, offering low-fee trading with AI-driven tooling.
- **AI Terminal**: A user interface enabling bridging, swapping, and trading across Mode’s ecosystem, enhanced by Synth’s predictive data.
- **Restaking Solutions**: Collaborations with protocols like Renzo and EtherFi to optimize ETH yields.

**Significance**: Mode pioneers the "DeFAI" (Decentralized Finance + AI) narrative, positioning itself as a hub for AI-driven financial applications. Its integration with Optimism’s Superchain provides access to Ethereum’s security while enabling high-throughput, low-cost transactions tailored for AI agents.

## Technology

**Stack & Innovations**:

- **OP Stack Foundation**: Uses Optimism’s rollup architecture for Ethereum scalability.
- **Modular Design**: Separates execution, data, and consensus layers, with a specialized **data layer** combining oracles (API3, Pyth, Redstone) and Synth, a Bittensor subnet generating synthetic price-prediction data for AI agents.
- **AI Execution Layer**: Allows agents to autonomously execute DeFi strategies, forecast markets, and optimize yields.

**Technical Approach**:

- **Sequencer Fee Sharing**: Redirects a portion of transaction fees to developers and users who drive ecosystem growth.
- **Agent-Centric Infrastructure**: Provides APIs and SDKs for deploying AI agents capable of interacting with DeFi protocols.

**Problems Solved**:

- Scalability limitations for AI-driven dApps.
- Fragmented data access for AI models via decentralized oracles.
- Incentive misalignment in traditional DeFi through contribution-based rewards.

## Key Features

- **AI-Optimized L2**: Built specifically for autonomous agents, with native support for agent-to-agent transactions.
- **Synthetic Data Integration**: Synth’s Bittensor subnet provides AI models with probabilistic price forecasts.
- **Gasless Cross-Chain Swaps**: Powered by Matcha’s aggregation protocol.
- **Modular Security**: Inherits Ethereum’s security while enabling customizations via Optimism’s Bedrock upgrade.
- **Multi-Chain Interoperability**: Seamlessly interacts with 30+ OP Stack chains.
- **DeFAI Accelerator Program**: Funds AI-focused projects, such as predictive trading vaults.
- **Restaking Primitive**: ETH restaking integrates with EigenLayer for enhanced yield generation.

## Integration with Eliza

Mode Network integrates with ElizaOS to enable AI agents to operate within its DeFi ecosystem. Key synergies include:

- **Agent Deployment**: ElizaOS agents can autonomously execute trades, manage portfolios, and interact with Mode’s Perpetuals DEX via TypeScript-based plugins.
- **Data Synergy**: Mode’s Synth subnet feeds synthetic Bitcoin price data into ElizaOS agents, improving their predictive capabilities.
- **Cross-Chain Automation**: Eliza agents bridge assets between Mode and Bitcoin via Merlin Chain, leveraging Mode’s infrastructure for settlements.

**Use Cases**:

- AI agents performing arbitrage across Mode’s liquidity pools.
- Automated yield farming strategies using restaked ETH.
- Portfolio rebalancing triggered by Synth’s forecasting models.
