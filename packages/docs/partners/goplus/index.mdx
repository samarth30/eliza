Security data network for Web3.

## About GoPlus

GoPlus operates as Web3's decentralized security infrastructure, providing open, permissionless security services through modular APIs and AI-powered solutions. Founded to address critical gaps in blockchain security, it functions as an automated detection platform covering token risks, NFT authenticity, malicious addresses, and smart contract vulnerabilities.

**Main Products/Services**:

- **Security API Suite**: Real-time detection APIs for tokens, NFTs, dApps, and malicious addresses
- **SafeToken Protocol**: Standardizes secure token creation and liquidity management
- **SecNet**: Layer 2 blockchain firewall monitoring high-risk transactions
- **Security SDKs**: Developer tools for integrating security features into wallets/exchanges
- **GoPlus Chrome Extension**: Real-time phishing detection and transaction simulation

As a leader in Web3 security, GoPlus safeguards over 12 million wallets and processes 30 million daily API calls across 30+ blockchains. Its infrastructure prevents billions in potential losses through proactive threat detection.

## Technology

GoPlus combines **decentralized security networks** with AI-driven analytics:

- **AVS (Active Verification System)**: Distributes security validation across independent node operators
- **Modular Security Architecture**: Plug-and-play components like GSM (GoPlus Security Module) for dApps
- **Multi-chain Transaction Simulation**: Previews contract interactions across EVM/non-EVM chains
- **ZK-Proof Verification**: Enhances privacy for sensitive security operations

The stack solves critical Web3 pain points:

1. Rug pull prevention through token contract analysis
2. Phishing site blocking via real-time URL database
3. Approval exploit mitigation with smart contract permission audits

## Key Features

- **Cross-chain Security Engine**: Unified risk detection for 30+ networks (Ethereum, BSC, Solana)
- **Dynamic API Library**: 800K+ malicious addresses and 400K+ risky token contracts indexed
- **Personalized Security Strategies**: User-configurable risk thresholds for transactions
- **On-chain Firewall**: Intercepts high-risk transactions at RPC/sequencer level
- **Security-as-a-Service Marketplace**: Developers monetize custom detection algorithms
- **Wallet DNA Analysis**: Behavioral profiling for anomaly detection

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin exists in public repositories, technical synergies appear through:

1. **API-Level Integration**: ElizaOS likely accesses GoPlus' security engines via JavaScript/Python SDKs
2. **Shared Security Modules**: Joint solutions for wallet authorization checks and contract audits
3. **Unified Risk Dashboard**: Aggregated security alerts within Eliza's interface
4. **Co-Developed Standards**: Collaborative work on SafeToken protocols for asset issuance

This partnership enables Eliza users to:

- Perform real-time contract simulations before signing
- Access cross-chain approval revocation tools
- Receive automated phishing site blocking

## Recent Developments

**2025 Milestones**:

- Launched GPS token governing decentralized security network (Q1 2025)
- Expanded to Avalanche Subnets and Bitcoin L2s (March 2025)
- Partnered with Ledger Live for hardware wallet integration (April 2025)
- Chrome Extension v0.2.1 with enhanced phishing detection (April 2025)

**Public Roadmap**:

- Decentralized security services marketplace (Q3 2025)
- ZK-powered privacy-preserving audits (2026)
- On-chain insurance protocol for covered exploits (2026)

## Market Position
