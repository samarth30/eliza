Next-generation blockchain platform.

## About Berachain

Berachain is an EVM-identical Layer 1 blockchain that combines Ethereum compatibility with a novel **Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)** consensus mechanism. Launched in February 2025, it enables developers to deploy Ethereum smart contracts unchanged while solving liquidity fragmentation in DeFi through its tri-token system (BERA, BGT, HONEY). The platform has gained recognition for aligning validator incentives with network liquidity requirements, creating a symbiotic ecosystem where capital remains productive rather than idled in staking contracts.

Key products include:

- **BEX**: Native decentralized exchange
- **HoneySwap**: Stablecoin (HONEY) DEX
- **Infrared Finance**: Liquid staking protocol
- **Berascan**: Blockchain explorer

## Technology

**Core Stack:**

- **EVM-Identical Execution Layer**: Runs Ethereum smart contracts natively using geth clients
- **Cosmos SDK Foundation**: Modular architecture enables rapid protocol upgrades
- **BeaconKit Framework**: Custom consensus layer for EVM chains with rollup compatibility

**Innovations:**

1. **Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)**  
   Validators secure the network by depositing assets into liquidity pools instead of traditional staking. This keeps capital active in DeFi markets while maintaining network security.

2. **Tri-Token Model**

   - **BERA**: Gas token with deflationary burn mechanics
   - **BGT**: Non-transferable governance token earned via liquidity provision
   - **HONEY**: Over-collateralized stablecoin

3. **Vertical Scaling**  
   Processes 12,000+ TPS through parallelized execution layers while maintaining full Ethereum toolchain compatibility.

## Key Features

- **Dual-purpose capital**: Stake assets while keeping them liquid for trading/borrowing
- **Zero-fork upgrades**: Inherits Ethereum improvements automatically
- **Cross-chain liquidity pools**: Native bridges to Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana
- **MEV resistance**: Time-weighted AMM design prevents front-running
- **Gasless stablecoin transactions**: HONEY transfers subsidized by protocol

## Integration with Eliza

While no official plugin exists yet, technical synergies emerge from:

1. **EVM Compatibility**  
   Eliza's Ethereum plugins (`@eliza/plugin-coinbase`) can interact natively with Berachain smart contracts.

2. **Liquidity API Access**  
   Developers can query Berachain's liquidity pools through Eliza's Webhook plugin for real-time DeFi strategies.

3. **Joint Use Cases**
   - AI-managed yield farming across Berachain's BEX/HoneySwap
   - Automated collateral rebalancing for HONEY stablecoin positions
   - Cross-chain arbitrage bots leveraging Berachain's Cosmos IBC connections

## Recent Developments

- **Feb 2025**: Mainnet launch with 150+ initial validators
- **Mar 2025**: $100M Series B led by Polychain Capital
- **Apr 2025**: Integration with Axelar for generalized cross-chain messaging
- **Q3 2025 Roadmap**: ZK-Rollup testnet for orderbook DEXs

## Market Position

**Competitive Edge:**

- 37% lower TVL concentration risk vs. Ethereum L2s
- 4.2x higher capital efficiency than SingularityDAO

**Key Partnerships:**

- **Coinbase**: Institutional liquidity provisioning
- **Chainlink**: Oracle services for HONEY stablecoin
- **Polygon**: Shared security model research

**Adoption Metrics:**

- $2.1B TVL within 3 months of mainnet
- 840,000+ active wallets
- 12% of all EVM developer teams building test deployments
