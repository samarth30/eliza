AI agent for Web3.

## About Society Library

Society Library operates at the intersection of AI, decentralized governance, and collective intelligence, focusing on **deliberative democracy as a service**. Their platform enables structured debate and decision-making for AI-related ethical and technical challenges through:

- **AI-powered debate mapping**: Using natural language processing to analyze and visualize complex discussions about AI safety, ethics, and governance
- **Decentralized consensus tools**: Blockchain-based voting mechanisms for community-driven resolutions
- **Public benefit infrastructure**: Open-source frameworks for equitable access to AI capabilities

They gained recognition for mapping AI alignment/safety debates using machine learning (2023) and pioneering **"conceptual portmanteau" systems** that merge disparate web content into coherent knowledge structures.

## Technology

**Stack**:

- Hybrid blockchain architecture (Solana/Ethereum) for immutable debate records
- LLM fine-tuning (Llama/Mistral) for argument analysis
- On-chain reputation systems for participant scoring

**Innovations**:

- **Blind Spot Detection**: AI systems that surface unconsidered perspectives in debates
- **Steel-Man Generator**: Automatically creates strongest versions of opposing arguments
- **Social Media Synthesizer**: Aggregates fragmented web discourse into structured dialogues

Solves **information asymmetry** in decentralized governance and reduces **AI bias propagation** through verifiable debate trails.

## Key Features

- 🧩 Modular debate templates for DAO governance
- 🔍 Cross-platform discourse analysis (Twitter/Discord/Farcaster)
- 🔐 ZK-proofs for anonymous voting with reputation scoring
- 🤖 Autonomous agent participation in debates
- 📊 Real-time visualization of argument networks
- 🛡️ Bias-detection API for AI outputs
- 🌐 Multilingual consensus interfaces

## Integration with Eliza

The official **@eliza/plugin-society-library** enables:

```typescript
import { Society } from '@eliza/plugin-society-library';

agent.use(
  Society({
    debateTopics: ['AI Safety', 'DAO Governance'],
    votingWeight: 0.75,
  })
);
```

**Use Cases**:

- Eliza agents participate in governance debates as synthetic voters
- Access structured argument maps for decision-making
- Auto-generate policy proposals from community discussions

**Technical Synergy**:

- Shared cryptographic primitives for cross-platform identity
- Integrated reputation bridges between Eliza's TEE and Society Library's on-chain system

## Recent Developments

- **Q1 2025**: Launched "Deliberative Democracy as a Service" API suite
- **Dec 2024**: Partnered with Anthropic on constitutional AI alignment
- **Ongoing**: Developing quantum-resistant debate archival system

**Roadmap**:

- Agent-to-agent debate leagues (Q3 2025)
- FHE-based private voting (2026)
