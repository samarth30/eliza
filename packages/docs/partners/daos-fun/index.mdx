DAO management platform.

## About daos.fun

Daos.fun is a decentralized platform built on Solana that enables creators and fund managers to launch liquid investment DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). It specializes in meme fund creation, allowing users to raise capital through SOL contributions, issue tradable DAO tokens, and automate profit-sharing mechanisms. The platform gained prominence for lowering barriers to hedge fund operations in Web3, particularly for meme coin investments. Its flagship feature includes a "smart wallet" system that transparently manages assets on behalf of token holders.

**Main products/services**:

- Turnkey DAO creation tools with custom fundraising parameters
- Virtual AMM markets for DAO token trading
- Automated profit distribution systems
- Compliance-focused fund management infrastructure

**Significance**:  
Daos.fun has become a focal point for viral crypto projects, notably hosting the ai16z/ElizaOS AI-managed fund that achieved a 650x return in 72 hours. It represents a new paradigm for liquid democratic investing, combining memes, AI agents, and decentralized governance.

**## Technology**  
**Stack**:

- Built on Solana for high-speed transactions and low fees
- Smart contract-powered treasury management
- Integrated with Saga's Chainlets for potential L1 blockchain expansion

**Innovations**:

1. **Fair Launch Mechanism**: Guarantees equal token pricing during initial offerings
2. **Liquid Fund Structure**: Tokens trade via virtual AMM while underlying assets remain locked
3. **Automatic Redemption**: Smart contracts enable SOL redemptions (with 10% penalty) if fundraising fails

**Problem Solving**:

- Democratizes hedge fund creation (minimum 20 SOL to launch)
- Eliminates traditional fund administration costs
- Solves liquidity challenges through tokenized exposure

---

**## Key Features**

1. **No-Code DAO Creation**: Launch investment vehicles in &lt;10 minutes with customizable terms
2. **Transparent Profit Sharing**: 80-95% returns distributed proportionally to token holders
3. **Meme Fund Specialization**: Tools optimized for viral crypto asset management
4. **AI Agent Integration**: Native support for autonomous AI fund managers like ElizaOS
5. **Multi-Signature Governance**: Combining creator control with community voting
6. **Cross-Platform Trading**: DAO tokens listed simultaneously on centralized/decentralized exchanges
7. **Creator Vetting System**: KYC/AML checks for fund managers

---

**## Integration with Eliza**  
Daos.fun serves as the primary launchpad for ElizaOS-managed funds. Technical integration includes:

**Synergies**:

- Eliza's AI agents use Daos.fun smart contracts to execute trades
- DAO token prices reflect AI trading performance in real-time
- Shared governance through AI16Z token voting

**Use Cases**:

- AI-managed meme index funds
- Algorithmic treasury rebalancing
- Community-augmented AI strategies

**User Benefits**:

- Direct exposure to AI trading strategies through liquid tokens
- Combined human/AI governance models
- Real-time portfolio tracking via shared dashboards

While no official GitHub plugin exists yet, the integration occurs through custom API endpoints that allow ElizaOS agents to interact with Daos.fun's investment protocols.
