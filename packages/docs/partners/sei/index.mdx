Layer 1 blockchain optimized for trading.

## About Sei

Sei specializes in infrastructure for decentralized trading, targeting DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and high-frequency trading applications. Its architecture combines Cosmos SDK fundamentals with novel optimizations to achieve 12,500 transactions per second (TPS) and 380ms block finality. Key offerings include:

- **Native order-matching engine** for decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
- **Parallelized execution** for independent transactions
- **EVM compatibility** via Sei v2, enabling Ethereum developer migration

As the first blockchain to implement a parallelized EVM, Sei bridges Solana-like performance with Ethereum’s ecosystem, positioning itself as a critical infrastructure provider for on-chain trading.

## Technology

### Core Innovations

- **Twin-Turbo Consensus**: Merges optimistic block processing with intelligent propagation to reduce latency.
- **SeiDB**: Optimized storage layer that minimizes node bloat and accelerates synchronization.
- **Market-Based Parallelization**: Processes transactions across independent markets concurrently.
- **Frequent Batch Auctions**: Mitigates frontrunning by clearing orders at uniform prices.
- **EVM-SDK Interoperability**: Supports both EVM and Cosmos SDK-based smart contracts.

## Key Features

1. **12,500 TPS** with sub-second finality for real-time trading.
2. **Parallelized EVM** enabling 100x throughput gains over competitors.
3. **Built-in Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)** for institutional-grade trading.
4. **Optimistic rollups** to batch transactions off-chain.
5. **Single-block execution** for atomic trade settlements.
6. **Frontrunning protection** via frequent batch auctions.
7. **Sei v2** upgrade with backward-compatible EVM and enhanced developer tools.

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin has been publicly announced, technical synergies exist:

- **EVM Compatibility**: ElizaOS could leverage Sei’s parallelized EVM for cross-chain asset management.
- **Native APIs**: Sei’s order-matching engine might enable Eliza users to execute trades directly within interfaces.
- **Use Cases**: Portfolio rebalancing, decentralized exchange aggregation, and NFT liquidity provision.

Potential benefits include reduced latency for Eliza users and access to Sei’s DeFi-centric ecosystem.

## Recent Developments

- **Sei v2 Launch** (2024): Introduced parallelized EVM and SeiDB storage layer.
- **Ecosystem Grants**: Allocated funds to projects like DragonSwap (AMM) and Pallet Exchange (NFT marketplace).
- **Institutional Partnerships**: Collaborations with Pyth Network for real-time price feeds.
- **Mainnet Upgrade** (2023): Achieved 390ms finality, becoming the fastest Layer 1 by block confirmation time.

## Market Position

- **Competitive Edge**: Outperforms Solana in finality speed and Ethereum in trading-specific optimization.
- **Key Partners**: Pyth Network, Magic Eden, and multiple Cosmos-based chains.
- **Adoption**: Hosts 50+ dApps post-mainnet launch, with $85M in raised capital from investors like Multicoin Capital.
