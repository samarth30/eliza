Omnichain interoperability protocol.

## About LayerZero

LayerZero is a foundational omnichain interoperability protocol that enables seamless cross-chain communication between blockchains. By acting as a universal messaging layer, it allows smart contracts on different networks to interact directly, empowering developers to build applications that operate as unified entities across 70+ chains. Its infrastructure supports major ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and Hedera, and is trusted by institutions including PayPal, Ethena, and the HBAR Foundation.

**Main Products/Services**:

- Omnichain smart contract messaging protocol
- Cross-chain asset bridges (e.g., LayerZero USDC)
- Developer tools for building OApps (Omnichain Applications)
- Secure verification systems using decentralized oracles and relayers

LayerZero addresses critical blockchain fragmentation by enabling unified liquidity pools, eliminating siloed ecosystems, and reducing technical complexity for cross-chain development.

## Technology

LayerZero employs a novel architecture combining:

- **Ultra Light Nodes (ULNs)**: Maintain cryptographic proofs of transactions across chains
- **Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs)**: Third-party node operators for message validation
- **Immutable on-chain endpoints**: Censorship-resistant communication channels
- **Configurable security stack**: Developers choose verification methods per application

Messages are validated through a dual system:

1. Relayers submit transaction proofs
2. Oracles (e.g., Chainlink) verify block headers  
   This "trust-minimized" approach ensures instant finality for cross-chain transactions while preventing single points of failure.

**Key Innovations**:

- First protocol to enable arbitrary data transfers (beyond simple token bridging)
- Non-upgradeable core contracts for protocol immutability
- MultiVM compatibility (EVM, Solana VM, Cosmos SDK)

## Key Features

1. **Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFT)**: Native assets operable across all connected chains
2. **Cross-Chain State Sync**: Real-time smart contract state sharing between networks
3. **Gas Abstraction**: Users pay fees in any supported token
4. **Modular Security**: Customizable verification via 15+ DVN providers
5. **Atomic Transactions**: Multi-chain operations within single tx flows
6. **Enterprise-Grade Compliance**: Integration with institutional infrastructure (e.g., Hedera Token Service)
7. **EVM++**: Extends Ethereum compatibility to non-EVM chains like Solana

## Integration with Eliza

The LayerZero-ElizaOS partnership enables:

- **Cross-Chain AI Agents**: Autonomous agents operating across 70+ chains via unified messaging
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: On-chain data indexing from multiple networks for AI training
- **Multi-VM Smart Contracts**: Combines Eliza's Rust-based Stylus contracts with EVM/Solana VM

While no official plugin repository exists in elizaos-plugins GitHub organization, integration occurs through:

1. **Arbitrum MultiVM Architecture**: Deploys Eliza agents on Arbitrum with LayerZero cross-chain extensions
2. **Tokenized Incentives**: LayerZero-powered USDC payments for agent services
3. **Interchain Oracles**: Combines Chainlink data feeds with cross-chain verification
