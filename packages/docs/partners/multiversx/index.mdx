## About MultiversX

MultiversX is an internet-scale blockchain platform designed to support next-generation decentralized applications through its high-throughput architecture. It operates as a distributed network with 3,000+ nodes, leveraging adaptive state sharding to achieve enterprise-grade scalability while maintaining security and energy efficiency. The platform provides infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi), metaverse ecosystems, and enterprise solutions, with native integration of smart contracts and digital assets.

**Main Products/Services**:

- EGLD cryptocurrency for staking, payments, and network governance
- Smart contract execution environment via MultiversX WASM Virtual Machine
- xExchange decentralized exchange and xPortal super app for digital finance
- Sovereign chain solutions for enterprise blockchain customization

As a leader in sharding technology, MultiversX addresses blockchain's scalability trilemma through its novel technical architecture, positioning itself as a foundational layer for Web3 infrastructure.

## Technology

**Core Innovations**:

1. **Adaptive State Sharding**: Dynamically splits/merges network partitions based on load, enabling horizontal scaling to 15,000+ TPS
2. **Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS)**: Consensus completed in 2 communication steps using BLS multi-signatures, with random validator rotation
3. **Cross-Shard Atomic Transactions**: Processes cross-shard operations in seconds through asynchronous execution protocol
4. **MultiversX WASM VM**: Executes smart contracts compiled from Rust/C/C++ with deterministic gas metering
5. **Node Resilience System**: Automated node reshuffling across shards every epoch to prevent collusion

This stack solves critical blockchain limitations:

- **Scalability**: Processes 263M daily transactions at peak capacity
- **Energy Efficiency**: 99.9% lower energy consumption vs traditional PoW chains
- **Finality**: 6-second transaction finality even for cross-shard operations

---

## Key Features

- **15,000 TPS** base capacity with linear scaling through shard multiplication
- **μ5** latency – 5-millisecond latency for intra-shard transactions
- **Zero gas fees** for failed transactions through "sender pays" model
- **On-chain 2FA**: Guardian system for wallet security via authenticator apps
- **Carbon-negative** network verified by ClimateTrade partnership
- **Rust-based smart contracts** with formal verification capabilities
- **150+ live dApps** including DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces

## Integration with Eliza

MultiversX developed the **mx-agent-kit** – an open-source framework enabling AI agents to interact with its blockchain through ElizaOS. Key integration capabilities:

**Technical Synergies**:

- Autonomous cross-shard transaction execution via AI-driven smart contracts
- Direct EGLD/ESDT token management through API endpoints
- AI-powered liquidity provisioning on xExchange
- Multi-network support (mainnet/devnet) for agent testing

**Use Cases**:

1. AI-controlled DAO treasuries executing multi-chain asset transfers
2. ML models performing real-time arbitrage across DEX pools
3. Automated compliance checks for institutional transactions

The [Eliza Plugin](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-agent-kit) features secure transaction signing with automatic nonce management and real-time status tracking, enabling trustless AI operations on-chain.
