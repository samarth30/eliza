AI agent launcher for Web3.

## About Mee.fun

Mee Fun operates as an AI agent launchpad specializing in Web3 ecosystems, enabling users to create, deploy, and monetize autonomous AI agents without requiring coding expertise. Its platform combines no-code tools with blockchain integration, allowing creators to design agents for decentralized finance (DeFi), social media automation, and Web3 gaming applications. As a partner of ElizaOS, it plays a role in democratizing AI agent development by simplifying access to ElizaOS’s open-source framework for multi-agent simulations.

Key offerings include:

- **No-code agent builder**: Intuitive interface for designing AI agents with predefined workflow templates.
- **Tokenization tools**: Minting and managing utility tokens tied to agent functionality or governance.
- **Cross-chain compatibility**: Support for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains and Solana.

## Technology

Mee Fun leverages a modular architecture built on a Layer 2 blockchain to optimize transaction speed and reduce gas fees. Its stack includes:

- **Smart contract framework**: For automating agent interactions and revenue-sharing mechanisms.
- **AI middleware**: Integrates machine learning models like ChatGPT for natural language processing and decision-making.
- **Interoperability protocols**: Enables agents to interact with platforms like X (Twitter), Uniswap, and GamingFi ecosystems.

The platform addresses fragmented Web3 user experiences by allowing AI agents to execute tasks such as yield optimization, social media management, and cross-platform asset swaps programmatically.

## Key Features

1. **One-click agent deployment** for social media bots, DeFi traders, or gaming NPCs.
2. **Deflationary tokenomics** with agent creation burning native tokens to incentivize scarcity.
3. **Agent marketplace** for buying/selling pre-configured AI workflows.
4. **Real-time analytics dashboard** tracking agent performance across blockchains.
5. **Decentralized governance** where token holders vote on platform upgrades.

## Integration with Eliza

Mee Fun provides native compatibility with ElizaOS through an official plugin available in the elizaos-plugins GitHub repository. This integration enables:

- **Seamless agent migration**: Export Mee Fun agents directly into ElizaOS environments.
- **Shared liquidity pools**: Agents can interact with ElizaOS’s tokenized economy for tasks like collateralized borrowing.
- **Cross-platform interoperability**: Agents maintain consistent behaviors when operating across both ecosystems.

Technical synergies include shared TypeScript libraries for agent personality customization and joint security audits of smart contracts governing agent interactions.

## Recent Developments

- **Q2 2025**: Launched Solana-based NFT ticket system for premium agent templates.
- **March 2025**: Partnered with FightFi to integrate AI-powered battle agents in their social gaming metaverse.
- **Public roadmap**: Plans for Unity SDK to enable AI agent deployment in 3D gaming environments by Q3 2025.

## Market Position

Mee Fun competes with platforms like Virtuals Protocol and vvaifu.fun by offering deeper ElizaOS integration and EVM/Solana dual-chain support. Key differentiators include:

- **Lower minting fees**: 0.5% vs industry average 2-5% on competitor platforms.
- **Enterprise partnerships**: Collaboration with Sigma Music Agent for AI-generated content workflows.

Reported metrics (unverified):

- 15,000+ agents launched since 2024
- $4.2M in agent-generated revenue Q1 2025
