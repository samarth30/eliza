Smart account infrastructure for secure, flexible, and gasless transactions.

## About Safe

Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) is the leading decentralized custody protocol for managing digital assets, identities, and data on Ethereum and 100+ EVM networks. Founded in 2018 by Richard Meissner and Lukas Schor, its battle-tested smart accounts secure over **$100 billion in assets**, serving high-profile users like Vitalik Buterin, enterprise clients (Shopify), and protocols (AAVE, 1inch).

**Core Offerings**:

- **Safe Core**: Modular account abstraction stack for developers
- **Safe Wall**: Non-custodial interface for individuals/DAOs
- **Safe Pass**: Ecosystem reward program incentivizing smart account usage

As a foundational Web3 primitive, Safe aims to establish smart accounts as the default ownership standard, combining institutional-grade security with programmable transaction logic.

## Technology

### Modular Smart Account Architecture

- **Multi-sig foundation**: Requires threshold owner approvals (EOAs or smart contracts) for transactions
- **Extensible via**:
  - Plugins: Add custom logic (e.g., payment streaming, recovery)
  - Hooks: Trigger pre/post-transaction conditions
  - Signature Verifiers: Support passkeys/MPC alongside traditional ECDSA
- **Key Innovations**:
  - Batched transactions (atomic multi-operations)
  - ERC-721/1155 token callback support
  - Sponsored gas fees payable in ERC20 tokens
  - Transaction simulation previews

This architecture solves critical Web3 challenges: eliminating single-point key failures, enabling complex DAO governance, and abstracting gas mechanics for end-users.

## Key Features

- üîê **Configurable multi-sig** (1/N to M/N signer schemes)
- üß© **Modular extensions** via 14+ standardized modules (ERC-7579)
- ‚ö° **Gasless transactions** through relayers & ERC20 fee payments
- üîÑ **Batched operations** (e.g., swap‚Üístake‚Üívote in one tx)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Deployment across 100+ chains** with consistent security
- üìú **Fully audited** ‚Äì 30+ security audits since 2018
- ü§ñ **Integrated with 200+ dApps** including Uniswap and Lido

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin is documented, Safe's architecture enables seamless integration through:

1. **Safe Core API**: Directly embed smart accounts into ElizaOS workflows
2. **Custom Plugins**: Develop Eliza-specific modules for:
   - Cross-chain asset management
   - Automated treasury policies
3. **Shared Security Models**: Leverage Safe's audited multi-sig base layer
4. **Gas Abstraction**: Implement Eliza-branded sponsored transactions

This synergy could allow Eliza users to manage institutional-grade wallets without leaving the platform, combining Safe's security with Eliza's user experience.
