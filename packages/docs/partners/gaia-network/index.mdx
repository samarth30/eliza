Decentralized AI network.

## About Gaia Network

Gaia Network (GaiaNet) is a decentralized AI infrastructure project building a distributed network of edge nodes to host specialized AI models and agents. Unlike centralized AI systems, GaiaNet enables individuals and businesses to operate nodes containing AI agents trained on their proprietary domain knowledge, functioning as "AI twins" for real-world experts. The network focuses on privacy-preserving AI interactions while maintaining Web2-level user experience. Key offerings include decentralized inference servers, an AI agent deployment framework, and tools for creating personalized AI experiences.

In Web3/blockchain ecosystems, GaiaNet provides critical infrastructure for private AI computation, secure model training, and decentralized governance of AI systems. Its architecture enables novel use cases like confidential DeFi strategies, privacy-focused AI assistants, and community-governed agent networks.

## Technology

GaiaNet's stack combines:

- **Peer-to-Peer Edge Nodes**: Local AI inference servers running models like LLaMA 3B and Qwen-72B
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contracts for node coordination, staking, and incentive distribution
- **Confidential Computing**: Integration with Secret Network's encrypted computation environments
- **Modular Architecture**: Plug-and-play components for model serving, RAG pipelines, and multi-chain interoperability

The network solves key challenges in AI:

1. **Decentralized Model Serving**: Reduces reliance on centralized API providers
2. **Data Privacy**: Processes sensitive information locally on edge nodes
3. **Censorship Resistance**: Enables uncensorable AI applications through distributed infrastructure
4. **Incentive Alignment**: Tokenized rewards for node operators and model contributors

---

## Key Features

1. **Edge Node Network**: 10,000+ nodes (as of 2025 Q1) serving specialized AI models
2. **Multi-Model Support**: Simultaneous operation of LLaMA, Deepseek, and custom fine-tuned models
3. **EigenLayer Integration**: Active Validation Services (AVS) for node security and task verification
4. **Enterprise-Grade Tooling**: SDKs for AI agent deployment, monitoring, and version control
5. **Hybrid Workflows**: Seamless integration between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain AI logic
6. **Cross-Platform Agents**: Operate across Discord, Telegram, Farcaster, and major blockchain networks
7. **Incentive Marketplace**: Connects model creators, node operators, and end-users through tokenized rewards

## Integration with Eliza

OS  
The official **PostgreSQL Adapter Plugin** enables deep technical integration:

```javascript
// Sample ElizaOS configuration using GaiaNet
{
  "modelProvider": "gaianet",
  "modelSize": "medium",
  "embeddingModel": "nomic-embed",
  "postgresConfig": {
    "vectorExtension": "pgvector",
    "embeddingProvider": "gaianet"
  }
}
```

**Technical Synergies:**

- ElizaOS agents can switch between GaiaNet's small/medium/large models dynamically
- Shared vector databases using GaiaNet's Nomic embeddings (768 dimensions)
- Confidential agent operations via integration with Secret Network's privacy layer
- One-click deployment of AI agents to GaiaNet's node network

**Use Cases:**

- Privacy-preserving DeFi trading bots using on-chain data analysis
- Multi-platform customer service agents with enterprise knowledge bases
- Community-governed AI moderation systems

## Recent Developments

- **2024 Q3**: Launched testnet with 2,500 active nodes
- **2024 Nov**: Partnered with EigenLayer to implement AVS security ($12M TVL secured)
- **2025 Jan**: Integrated with Secret Network for encrypted agent transactions
- **2025 Q2**: Released "Mother" agent launchpad supporting Ethereum-based AI agents
- **Upcoming**: Cross-chain agent interoperability protocol (2025 Q3 roadmap)

---

## Market Position
