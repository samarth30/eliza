# GAIA NETWORK

## Core Overview

Gaia Network (GaiaNet) is a decentralized AI infrastructure enabling distributed edge nodes to host specialized AI models and agents. It allows individuals and businesses to operate nodes with "AI twins" trained on proprietary domain knowledge while preserving privacy and maintaining Web2-level UX. The system provides decentralized inference servers, an AI agent deployment framework, and personalized AI tools.

## Eliza Integration

**PostgreSQL Adapter Plugin** enables technical integration:

```javascript
{
 "modelProvider": "gaianet",
 "modelSize": "medium",
 "embeddingModel": "nomic-embed",
 "postgresConfig": {
   "vectorExtension": "pgvector",
   "embeddingProvider": "gaianet"
 }
}
```

**Technical Synergies:**

- Dynamic model switching (small/medium/large)
- Shared vector databases with Nomic embeddings (768 dimensions)
- Confidential operations via Secret Network
- One-click agent deployment to node network

**Use Cases:** Privacy-preserving DeFi bots, multi-platform customer service agents, AI moderation systems
