- Modular architecture separating execution from data availability and consensus
- Parallel transaction processing via FuelVM (custom virtual machine)
- Provides high throughput, low fees, and Ethereum compatibility
- Addresses monolithic blockchain limitations while maintaining security

## Key Products

- **FuelVM**: Purpose-built VM with expanded capabilities beyond EVM
- **Sway**: Rust-based language for smart contract development
- **Forc**: Developer toolkit for building/testing/deploying
- **Fuel Ignition**: Production-ready Ethereum L2 (launched March 2024)

## Recent Developments

- Fuel Agent Kit enabling AI agent interaction with dApps (Dec 2024)
- Beta-1 Testnet for developer contract deployment
- SwaySwap DEX demonstrating low-fee environment

## Market Position

- Outperforms EVM rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism) in throughput
- UTXO model differs from account-based systems like Solana
- Partnerships: Ankr (RPC services), Jump Crypto, Maven11 (investors)
- Ecosystem: SwayLend, Mira Protocol (DeFi partners)
- Testnet performance: 10,000+ TPS in controlled environments
