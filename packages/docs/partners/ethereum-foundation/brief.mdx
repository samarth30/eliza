# Ethereum Foundation

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a Swiss non-profit founded in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood. It catalyzes the Ethereum ecosystem through:

- Supporting research, development, education, and community-building
- Funding critical projects via the Ecosystem Support Program (ESP)
- Organizing the annual Devcon conference
- Running the Fellowship Program for underrepresented groups in Web3

As a steward of Ethereum's decentralization ethos, EF prioritizes open-source infrastructure and public goods rather than centrally directing development.
