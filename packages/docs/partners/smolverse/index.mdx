Web3 gaming platform.

## About Smolverse

Smolverse is a Web3 gaming metaverse centered around an ecosystem of eSports, PvP games, and NFT-driven experiences set on a fictional alien planet. It operates within the **TreasureDAO ecosystem**, a decentralized gaming publisher built on Arbitrum (an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain).

**Core Offerings**:

- **NFT Collections**: Smol Brains (flagship ERC-721 NFTs), Smol Bodies, Smol Pets, Smol Cars, and Smol Treasures (in-game resources).
- **Smolville**: A hybrid life-and-strategy simulation RPG in development by Darkbright Studio, featuring quests, crafting, and player marketplaces.
- **Interactive World**: A community-driven, walkable art environment that evolves alongside the lore and gameplay.

Smolverse emphasizes **community ownership**, with NFTs and in-game assets tradable on platforms like Trove using **$MAGIC**, the ecosystem’s native currency.

- **Agent-Driven Interactions**: AI agents may automate in-game tasks, manage resources, or facilitate NPC behaviors.
- **Technical Synergy**: ElizaOS’s multi-agent framework could enable dynamic storytelling or player support systems.
- **User Benefits**: Smolverse gains AI-driven features, while ElizaOS expands its use cases in decentralized gaming.
