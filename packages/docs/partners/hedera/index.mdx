Enterprise-grade public network for the decentralized economy.

## About Hedera

Hedera is an enterprise-grade public distributed ledger network designed for building decentralized applications (dApps) and enabling digital asset tokenization. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera uses the **hashgraph consensus algorithm**, which offers high throughput, low latency, and energy efficiency. The network is governed by the **Hedera Governing Council**, a coalition of 39 global organizations across industries like tech, finance, and academia, ensuring decentralized and collusion-resistant governance.

**Main Products/Services**:

- **Hedera Token Service (HTS)**: Enables creation and management of fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at scale.
- **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**: Provides verifiable timestamps and ordering for transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: EVM-compatible Solidity-based contracts for programmable logic.
- **Decentralized Identity Solutions**: Tools for secure identity management.

Hedera is significant in Web3 for bridging enterprise needs with decentralized technology, emphasizing regulatory compliance, sustainability, and enterprise-grade performance.

## Technology

Hedera’s core innovation is the **hashgraph consensus algorithm**, which uses:

- **Gossip-about-Gossip Protocol**: Nodes share transaction data in a decentralized mesh network, enabling rapid information spread.
- **Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)**: Ensures security even if ⅓ of nodes are malicious.
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Structure**: Processes transactions in parallel, achieving **10,000+ TPS** with 3-5 second finality.

**Key Innovations**:

- Energy efficiency (0.000003 kWh per transaction, 1,000x more efficient than Visa).
- Predictable **$0.0001 transaction fee** regardless of network load.
- Open-source codebase managed by the Linux Foundation since 2024.

**Problems Solved**:

- Scalability bottlenecks in traditional blockchains.
- High energy consumption of proof-of-work systems.
- Centralization risks in governance models.

## Key Features

- **High Throughput**: Processes 10,000+ transactions per second.
- **Carbon-Negative Operations**: Offsets emissions via carbon credits.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: aBFT consensus and council governance.
- **EVM Equivalence**: Seamless integration with Ethereum tooling.
- **Native Tokenization**: Create custom tokens with built-upon compliance controls.
- **Fair Transaction Ordering**: Prevents front-running via consensus timestamps.
- **Global Node Network**: Operated by diverse organizations across 6 continents.

## Integration with Eliza

While no publicly disclosed ElizaOS plugin exists, Hedera’s infrastructure offers natural synergies:

- **API-Driven Access**: Developers can use Hedera’s SDKs (JavaScript, Java, Go) to integrate tokenization, smart contracts, or identity solutions into ElizaOS apps.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Tokenized asset management via Eliza’s interface.
  - Verifiable credentials using Hedera’s decentralized identity tools.
  - Micropayment systems powered by HBAR’s low fees.
- **Potential Benefits**:
  - Eliza users gain access to Hedera’s high-speed, compliant infrastructure.
  - Hedera expands its ecosystem through Eliza’s developer community.
