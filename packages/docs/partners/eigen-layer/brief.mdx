# Eigen Layer Summary

## Core Concept

Eigen Layer is an Ethereum restaking protocol allowing staked ETH or liquid staking tokens to secure multiple decentralized services (AVSs) simultaneously, creating a shared security marketplace and improving capital efficiency.

## Key Components

- **Restaking Infrastructure**: Supports ETH and LST restaking (stETH, rETH)
- **AVS Ecosystem**: 50+ services in development (EigenDA, oracles, bridges)
- **Operator Marketplace**: Validators earn from multiple services through delegation

## Integration Possibilities

- API access for in-app restaking
- AVS development via SDKs
- Delegation through OS interfaces

## Recent Milestones

- April 2025: EigenDA mainnet launch (1.2M txs/day)
- Q1 2025: $100M Series B at $8B valuation
- Partnerships with Binance and Kraken for institutional restaking

## Market Position

- 80% restaking market share ($8B TVL)
- 200,000+ active restakers, 1,400+ operators
- Key partnerships: Lido, Binance, Renzo
- Roadmap: 100+ AVSs by Q3 2025, EIGEN token staking
