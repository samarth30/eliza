Complete web3 development framework.

## About Thirdweb

Thirdweb is a complete Web3 development framework offering an integrated toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and blockchain infrastructure. Their platform streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from contract creation to deployment and analytics monitoring. Key offerings include:

- **Smart Contract Tools**: Prebuilt templates for NFTs, tokens, and marketplaces, with Solidity SDK support.
- **Wallet Infrastructure**: Embedded wallets, social logins, and smart wallets powered by account abstraction.
- **Payments & Monetization**: NFT checkout, gasless transactions, and cross-chain bridging via Universal Bridge.
- **Infrastructure Services**: Decentralized storage (IPFS), RPC Edge for optimized node access, and thirdweb Insight for onchain analytics.

Thirdweb serves as a critical infrastructure layer for Web3, supporting over 350 EVM-compatible chains and used by projects like Safe and Curve Finance.

## Technology

Thirdweb's stack combines modular architecture with open-source components:

- **Multi-Chain SDKs**: JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Python, Unity, and C# SDKs for cross-platform development.
- **AI Integration**: thirdweb Nebula enables AI agents to interact with blockchains using natural language.
- **Account Abstraction**: Smart wallets with gas optimization and transaction batching.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Hybrid IPFS pinning and ZK-proof RPC verification.

Their technology solves key Web3 challenges: fragmented tooling, poor user onboarding, and scalability limitations. The platform abstracts blockchain complexity while maintaining composability with existing protocols.

## Key Features

1. **All-in-One Toolkit**: From contract deployment ([ERC-721, ERC-1155](https://thirdweb.com/contracts)) to frontend UI components.
2. **Gasless Transactions**: Sponsor user gas fees via Universal Bridge's 1% protocol fee model.
3. **Cross-Chain Interop**: Built-in bridging for 20+ chains including Ethereum, Polygon, and Soneium Mainnet.
4. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Role-based access control and audit-ready contract templates.
5. **Real-Time Analytics**: Track contract interactions, user activity, and revenue streams.
6. **AI-Powered Development**: Generate contracts via natural language prompts using Nebula AI.
7. **Scalable Backend**: thirdweb Engine provides transaction queuing and auto-scaling RPCs.

## Integration with Eliza

Thirdweb's **Nebula** AI framework directly integrates with ElizaOS through:

1. **Plugin Architecture**: Official [elizaos-plugins/thirdweb](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/thirdweb) repository provides:
   - Smart contract interaction via natural language
   - Automated wallet management within AI agents
   - Onchain data querying through thirdweb Insight
2. **Joint Use Cases**:
   - AI agents that autonomously execute contracts
   - AI-powered NFT minting workflows
   - Cross-chain asset management via conversational UI
3. **Synergies**: Combines Thirdweb's blockchain infrastructure with Eliza's agent orchestration, enabling:
   - No-code dApp creation
   - AI-enhanced transaction simulations
   - Unified identity across Web2/Web3 systems
