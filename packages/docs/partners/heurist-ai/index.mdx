AI research platform.

## About Heurist.ai

Heurist AI is a decentralized protocol built as a ZK Layer-2 network specializing in AI model hosting and inference. Its mission is to democratize access to AI by leveraging distributed GPU resources through a blockchain-powered ecosystem. The platform enables serverless access to open-source AI models, allowing developers and enterprises to bypass centralized cloud providers' costs and censorship limitations. Founded in 2023, Heurist positions itself as the "HuggingFace of Web3," focusing on decentralized, permissionless AI innovation.

**Main Offerings**:

- Decentralized AI inference API for model deployment
- GPU resource marketplace for compute power sharing
- Tokenized incentives for network participants (miners, validators, developers)
- Blockchain-native AI model registry and fine-tuning tools

## Technology

Heurist's infrastructure combines several key innovations:

- **ZK Stack Integration**: Uses zero-knowledge proofs for scalable, privacy-preserving AI inference verification.
- **DePIN Architecture**: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) coordinates GPU owners globally to form an elastic compute pool.
- **ACE Model**: Alignment-Centric Economics aligns stakeholders (miners, users, validators) through the Heurist Token (HEU), which governs resource allocation, payments, and protocol upgrades.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Algorithms match AI workloads with optimal GPU nodes based on latency, cost, and capability requirements.

This stack solves critical AI/compute challenges: reducing reliance on centralized cloud providers, eliminating vendor lock-in, and enabling open-source AI model deployment at scale.

## Key Features

- 1. **Decentralized AI Inference**: Run models like Llama 3 or Stable Diffusion across a global GPU network instead of centralized servers.
- 2. **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**: Fractional HEU token payments for inference tasks, billed by compute-second.
- 3. **Censorship-Resistant Model Hosting**: Deploy AI models without platform restrictions or takedown risks.
- 4. **Token Burning Mechanism**: HEU tokens are burned for high-demand models, creating deflationary pressure during peak usage.
- 5. **TEE Integration**: Supports Trusted Execution Environments for sensitive AI workloads via partnerships with Marl.in and Phala Network.
- 6. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Native bridges to Ethereum, Solana, and zkSync for seamless multi-chain interactions.

## Integration with Eliza

OS  
Heurist serves as the primary AI inference layer for ElizaOS agents through:

- **Direct API Integration**: Eliza agents natively access Heurist's model catalog via REST API endpoints.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Official `elizaos-heurist` plugin enables agents to dynamically select AI models based on task requirements and cost constraints.
- **Joint Research Initiatives**: Collaborative development of "bribe mechanism" staking, where HEU holders prioritize specific AI models for Eliza agent usage.

Use cases include:

- Autonomous agent decision-making using Heurist-hosted LLMs
- On-demand image generation for Eliza's Holoworld metaverse characters
- Privacy-preserving KYC/AML checks via Heurist's TEE-verified models

## Recent Developments

- **Q1 2025**: Launched HEU token on Aerodrome and PancakeSwap, reaching $5.5M market cap within 90 days.
- **March 2025**: Partnered with Exabits to tokenize 4,000+ enterprise-grade GPUs for network expansion.
- **April 2025**: Integrated with ElizaOS's Auto.fun platform for no-code AI agent creation.
- **Public Roadmap**: Plans to onboard 100+ open-source AI models by Q3 2025 and achieve 10,000 mining node network by EOY.

## Market Position

Heurist competes with centralized AI platforms (HuggingFace, Replicate) and emerging Web3 projects (Gensyn, Bittensor):

| **Differentiator** | Heurist                          | Competitors           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Pricing Model**  | Micro-transactions via HEU token | Subscription-based    |
| **Censorship**     | Fully permissionless             | Content restrictions  |
| **Compute Source** | Global DePIN network             | Centralized cloud/HPC |

**Strategic Partnerships**:

- **Exabits**: Base layer for GPU resource tokenization
- **GenLayer**: Powers AI-native smart contracts
- **Space and Time**: ZK-proven data oracles for inference auditing
