# Heurist.ai Overview

## Core Offering

Heurist AI is a decentralized ZK Layer-2 protocol for AI model hosting and inference, built to democratize AI access through distributed GPU resources. Founded in 2023, it functions as the "HuggingFace of Web3" with:

- Decentralized AI inference API
- GPU resource marketplace
- Tokenized incentives system (HEU)
- Blockchain-native model registry

## ElizaOS Integration

- Direct REST API integration for agent access to model catalog
- `elizaos-heurist` plugin enabling dynamic model selection
- Collaborative "bribe mechanism" staking for model prioritization
- Used for agent decision-making, image generation, and privacy-preserving verification

## Recent Milestones

- Q1 2025: HEU token launch reaching $5.5M market cap
- March 2025: Partnership with Exabits to tokenize 4,000+ GPUs
- April 2025: Integration with ElizaOS's Auto.fun
- Roadmap: 100+ AI models by Q3 2025, 10,000 mining nodes by EOY

## Market Positioning

Differentiators from centralized platforms and Web3 competitors:

- Micro-transaction pricing via HEU token vs. subscription models
- Permissionless operation vs. content restrictions
- Global DePIN network vs. centralized computing

Key partners: Exabits (GPU infrastructure), GenLayer (AI smart contracts), Space and Time (ZK data oracles)
