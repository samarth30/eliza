Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

## About BNB Chain

BNB Chain is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain ecosystem designed for high-performance decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 services. Originating from Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain, it has evolved into a multi-chain architecture supporting DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and AI solutions. As one of the largest blockchain networks by transaction volume, BNB Chain processes over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality and gas fees under $0.01.

**Key components**:

- **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)**: EVM-compatible execution layer for smart contracts
- **opBNB**: Optimistic rollup Layer-2 scaling solution
- **BNB Greenfield**: Decentralized data storage network
- **zkBNB**: Zero-knowledge proof-powered scalability solution

The chain hosts 1,400+ active dApps across 10+ verticals and maintains $4.8B+ in total value locked (TVL), positioning it as a leading platform for Web3 mass adoption.

## Technology

BNB Chain employs a hybrid **Proof-of-Staked Authority (PoSA)** consensus mechanism combining:

- 29 active validators
- 4-second block times
- 100M gas limit per block

**Technical stack innovations**:

1. **EVM++**: Enhanced Ethereum Virtual Machine with native oracle support
2. **BAS (BNB Application Sidechain)**: Customizable L2/L3 chains
3. **BEP-367**: Modular blockchain upgrade framework
4. **AI-ready infrastructure**: On-chain ML model execution capabilities

The architecture solves blockchain trilemma challenges through:

- Horizontal scaling via opBNB (4,000-5,000 TPS capacity)
- Cross-chain interoperability with Binance Bridge
- Gas fee optimization algorithms reducing costs by 90% vs Ethereum

## Key Features

- **High-performance execution**: 2,000+ TPS with 0.5s block confirmation
- **EVM+ compatibility**: Full support for Solidity/Vyper with BSC-specific optimizations
- **Multi-chain ecosystem**: Integrated L1, L2, and storage solutions
- **AI integration layer**: Native support for AI agent frameworks through custom plugins
- **Developer suite**: $10M+ hackathon fund, faucet services, and debug tools
- **Decentralized governance**: On-chain voting for protocol upgrades
- **Institutional-grade security**: Formal verification for smart contracts

## Integration with Eliza

BNB Chain provides **official ElizaOS plugin** ([GitHub](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/bnb-chain)) enabling:

```solidity
// AI Agent Smart Contract Template
contract ElizaBNB {
    function executeAIJob(
        address agent,
        bytes memory input
    ) public payable returns (bytes memory) {
        return ElizaOSPlugin.execute{value: msg.value}(agent, input);
    }
}
```

**Technical synergies**:

- Direct access to BSC/BEP-20 token operations
- AI-driven DeFi strategies via Venus Protocol integration
- Automated NFT minting through BakerySwap APIs
- Real-time gas price prediction models

Use cases include:

- AI-controlled liquidity pools
- NFT generative art engines
- Risk-adjusted yield optimizers
- Cross-chain arbitrage bots
