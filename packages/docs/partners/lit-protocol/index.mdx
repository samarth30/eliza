Decentralized access control.

## About Lit Protocol

Lit provides **decentralized access control**, **programmable wallets**, and **serverless signing** through threshold cryptography and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Its network distributes encrypted key shares across nodes, ensuring no single entity controls full keys. Key offerings include:

- **Lit Actions**: JavaScript-powered smart agents that execute condition-based workflows across blockchains and Web2 platforms.
- **Decentralized Key Management**: Securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys without centralized custodians.
- **Cross-Chain/Web2 Interoperability**: Unified access control for EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon), Solana, Cosmos, and traditional web services.

As a pioneer in Web3 access control, Lit enables use cases like encrypted NFTs, data marketplaces, and self-sovereign identity systems, positioning it as critical infrastructure for user-owned internet applications.

## Technology

Lit’s architecture combines:

- **Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)**: Splits keys into shares distributed across nodes, requiring consensus for reconstruction.
- **Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)**: Ties decryption rights to on-chain credentials (e.g., NFT ownership).
- **Access Control Conditions (ACCs)**: Boolean logic for defining permissions (e.g., “User holds NFT X AND ≥1 ETH”).
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**: Hardware-enforced privacy for processing sensitive data.

This stack solves:

- **Key custodianship risks**: Eliminates single points of failure in key storage.
- **Cross-platform fragmentation**: Enables seamless interactions between Web2 services and multiple blockchains.
- **Data monetization**: Allows users to commercialize private data without exposing raw information.

## Key Features

- 1. **Cross-Network Composability**: Execute transactions and access data across EVM chains, Solana, Cosmos, and Web2 APIs.
- 2. **Programmable Cryptographic Agents**: Deploy Lit Actions to automate multichain workflows (e.g., auto-compound yields across DeFi protocols).
- 3. **Zero-Knowledge Key Recovery**: Retrieve lost keys via social credentials (Google OAuth, SIWS) without exposing secrets.
- 4. **Dynamic Content Gating**: Encrypt files/IPFS content decryptable only by wallets meeting ACCs.
- 5. **Decentralized Signing Network**: Generate network-level signatures for transactions or JWTs after condition verification.
- 6. **Wrapped Key System**: Non-custodial wallets with programmable spending rules (e.g., "Allow Uniswap swaps ≤$500/day").
- 7. **Confidential Compute Layer**: Process sensitive data (e.g., KYC details) within TEE-sealed environments.

## Integration with Eliza

ElizaOS integrates Lit via the **@elizaos/plugin-lit** module, which adds:

- **Lit Action Deployment**: Directly publish JavaScript-based cryptographic agents to the Lit network.
- **Secure Transaction Signing**: Use Lit’s threshold signatures for wallet operations like ERC-20 transfers or Uniswap swaps.
- **Encrypted Memory Management**: Protect Eliza agent data in OrbisDB using Lit’s ACC-gated decryption.

Example workflow:

```javascript
await elizaOS.lit.initialize();
const signature = await elizaOS.lit.tools.ecdsaSign({
  message: 'Agent instruction',
  chain: 'solana',
});
```

This enables Eliza agents to autonomously execute cross-chain transactions while maintaining compliance with predefined access policies.

## Recent Developments

- **Solana Mainnet Integration (2024)**: Added support for Solana program interactions and SPL token-gated content.
- **v1 Network Launch**: Transitioned to a fully decentralized node network with over 50 operators.
- **24M+ Requests Processed**: Milestone hit in Q1 2025, primarily driven by NFT platforms and DeFi automation.

## Market Position

Lit dominates decentralized key management with no direct competitors offering equivalent cross-chain TEE/MPC solutions. Key partnerships include:

- **Crossmint**: Lit powers unlockable content for NFT collections.
- **Collab.Land**: Enables token-gated Discord/Telegram access.
- **Streamr**: Provides encryption for decentralized data streams.

Adoption metrics:

- 180+ projects built on Lit (2025).
- 40% month-over-month growth in Solana-based integrations since 2024.
