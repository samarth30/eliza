# Lit Protocol

## Core Offering

A decentralized network for access control, programmable wallets, and serverless signing using threshold cryptography and TEEs. The system distributes encrypted key shares across nodes, preventing single-entity control.

## Key Features

- **Lit Actions**: JavaScript smart agents executing cross-chain workflows
- **Decentralized Key Management**: Non-custodial cryptographic key infrastructure
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Unified access control across EVM chains, Solana, Cosmos, and Web2

## ElizaOS Integration

Available via `@elizaos/plugin-lit`, enabling:

- Lit Action deployment directly to network
- Threshold signature-based transaction signing
- Encrypted memory management for agent data

Example:

```javascript
await elizaOS.lit.initialize();
const signature = await elizaOS.lit.tools.ecdsaSign({
  message: 'Agent instruction',
  chain: 'solana',
});
```

## Recent Milestones

- Solana mainnet support (2024)
- v1 decentralized network launch with 50+ operators
- 24M+ requests processed by Q1 2025
- 180+ projects built on platform
- 40% monthly growth in Solana integrations

## Key Partnerships

Crossmint (NFT unlockables), Collab.Land (token-gated access), Streamr (encrypted data)
