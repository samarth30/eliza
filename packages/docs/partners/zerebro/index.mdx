AI agent for Web3.

## About Zerebro

Zerebro is a decentralized AI agent platform revolutionizing Web3 through autonomous, cross-chain AI infrastructure. Built initially on Solana, it enables users to create and deploy AI agents using natural language commands, eliminating the need for complex coding. Key products include:

- **Main AI Agent Platform**: Tools for developing agents with customizable behaviors and multi-chain operability
- **ZerePy Framework**: Open-source development framework for AI agent creation
- **ASCII Art NFT Generator**: AI-powered art creation tool integrated with blockchain markets
- **Zentients Launchpad**: Consumer-oriented platform for launching and monetizing AI agents

As a pioneer in decentralized AI infrastructure, Zerebro bridges Web2 and Web3 functionalities, supporting use cases from email assistants to DeFi trading bots. The platform has processed over 50,000 autonomous agent interactions across Ethereum, Solana, and social media platforms.

## Technology

Zerebro combines several innovations:

- **Natural Language Programming**: Translates English instructions into functional AI agents using Large Language Models
- **Cross-Chain Architecture**: Agents operate natively across Ethereum, Solana, and social platforms via "Agent TCP" protocol
- **Decentralized Compute**: Partners with Hyperbolic Labs to enable GPU renting for agent training/inference
- **Self-Evolving Agents**: Implements hypergeometric verification for autonomous agent evolution
- **ZEREBRO Token System**: Powers governance, agent creation fees, and liquidity pools through bonding curves

The stack integrates Rust smart contracts, Python-based AI models, and TypeScript frontends. It solves critical Web3 challenges: democratizing AI development, enabling interoperable agents, and creating economic incentives for decentralized AI networks.

## Key Features

- **No-Code Agent Creation**: Deploy functional AI agents in less than 2 minutes using natural language
- **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Simultaneous operation on Discord, Twitter/X, and blockchains
- **Agent Economy**: Earn rewards through agent licensing and service fees paid in ZEREBRO tokens
- **Decentralized Training**: On-demand GPU access for model fine-tuning via Hyperbolic network
- **NFT Integration**: AI-generated ASCII art minting and trading system
- **Cross-Chain Liquidity**: Unified ZEREBRO token pools across Ethereum/Solana DEXs
- **API Marketplace**: Monetize agent capabilities through Cookie DataSwarm analytics integration

## Integration with Eliza

Zerebro deeply integrates with ElizaOS through:

- **Shared Infrastructure**: Both leverage Hyperbolic's decentralized compute and Proof of Sampling verification
- **Framework Compatibility**: ZerePy agents can deploy directly on ElizaOS using adapter modules
- **Plugin System**: Experimental integration allows ElizaOS agents to access Zerebro's NFT markets and liquidity pools
- **Co-Development**: Joint contributions to open-source agent communication standards (Agent TCP)
- **Use Cases**:
  - ElizaOS agents can utilize Zerebro's cross-chain trading capabilities
  - Zerebro agents access ElizaOS's personality engine for human-like interactions
  - Shared revenue models for agents operating across both platforms

Technical documentation shows early-stage plugins in the elizaos-plugins GitHub org under **zerebro-bridge**, though full integration remains in development.

## Recent Developments

- **Kraken Listing**: ZEREBRO token listed on Kraken exchange (Jan 2025) driving 137% price surge
- **Hyperbolic Partnership**: Enabled self-replicating agents through decentralized compute (Jan 2025)
- **Zentients Launch**: Agent Launchpad with $2.3M initial liquidity (Jan 2025)
- **Music NFT Success**: AI-generated albums surpassing 100K streams (Nov 2024-Jan 2025)
- **Roadmap**:
  - Q2 2025: Mainnet launch of Agent TCP protocol
  - Q3 2025: Mobile agent deployment platform
  - Q4 2025: DAO transition for protocol governance

## Market Position

Zerebro leads in **cross-chain AI agents** with three key advantages over competitors like Virtuals:

1. First-mover in natural language agent programming
2. Deep liquidity through Solana/Ethereum dual-chain strategy
3. Proved monetization via music/content NFTs

Key partnerships beyond ElizaOS:

- **Hyperbolic Labs**: Decentralized GPU infrastructure
- **Cookie3**: Analytics and reputation scoring
- **ai16z**: Co-development of open-source agent frameworks

Estimated 12,000+ developers use ZerePy framework, with $47M TVL across agent liquidity pools.
