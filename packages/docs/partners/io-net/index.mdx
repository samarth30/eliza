Decentralized compute network.

## About IO.net

Io.net operates the world's largest decentralized GPU cloud network, aggregating underutilized computing resources from data centers, crypto miners, and individual hardware providers across 138+ countries. Designed for AI/ML developers and startups, the platform delivers cost-efficient, on-demand compute power at up to 90% lower costs than traditional cloud providers like AWS. Its decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) model enables permissionless access to distributed GPU clusters, making it a critical infrastructure layer for democratizing AI development.

**Main Products/Services**:

- **IO Cloud**: Instant deployment of machine learning clusters via decentralized GPU pools.
- **IO Intelligence**: Custom AI model training and API integrations.
- **Worker Marketplace**: Monetization platform for GPU owners to rent idle resources.
- **Solana-Powered Payments**: Instant transactions for compute services using $IO tokens.

**Web3 Significance**: Io.net bridges the AI/ML resource gap by leveraging blockchain for transparent resource allocation, decentralized governance, and tokenized incentives. It’s a cornerstone project in the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector, valued at $32B as of 2025.

## Technology

**Stack & Innovations**:

- Built on **Solana** for high-speed payments and governance.
- Uses a customized **IO-SDK** (fork of Ray) for orchestrating distributed GPU clusters.
- Implements **mesh VPNs** and reverse tunneling for low-latency node communication.
- Multi-layered architecture with dedicated security (SOC2 compliance), API, and decentralized task management systems.

**Technical Approach**:  
The network aggregates GPUs into "super clusters" that function as unified compute units. Users deploy ML workloads through a unified dashboard, while blockchain ensures transparent pricing and Proof of Time-Lock validation to guarantee uninterrupted resource access.

**Problems Solved**:

- Eliminates cloud provider wait times (often months for specialized GPUs).
- Reduces compute costs by up to 90% compared to centralized alternatives.
- Democratizes AI development for SMEs lacking infrastructure budgets.

## Integration with Eliza

Io.net’s integration with ElizaOS focuses on providing seamless access to decentralized compute resources for AI-driven workflows. While no official ElizaOS plugin is documented in public repositories, the partnership likely enables:

- **Direct API Access**: ElizaOS users can deploy ML models on Io.net’s GPU clusters via API endpoints.
- **Unified Billing**: $IO token transactions for compute services within Eliza’s ecosystem.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Training AI agents using distributed GPU power.
  - On-demand inference for large language models (LLMs).

Developers should monitor the `elizaos-plugins` GitHub organization for potential future tools, such as cluster deployment templates or wallet-integrated payment gateways.
