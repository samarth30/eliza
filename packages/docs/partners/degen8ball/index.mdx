AI agent for crypto trading.

## About degen8ball

Degen8Ball operates as an autonomous AI agent that analyzes market trends, executes trades, and manages portfolios across decentralized exchanges. Its primary services include:

- **Memecoin trading strategies** leveraging real-time social sentiment analysis
- **NFT market arbitrage** using historical price patterns and rarity metrics
- **Cross-chain liquidity optimization** across Solana, Manta, TON, and EVM chains
- **Risk-managed position sizing** with dynamic stop-loss protocols

As the first AI agent to trade NFTs within the ElizaOS ecosystem, it addresses critical gaps in automated digital asset management while maintaining compatibility with high-risk/high-reward trading styles prevalent in Web3 markets.

## Technology

**Stack:**

- Built on ElizaOS's TypeScript framework with Rust smart contracts
- Integrates Phala Network's confidential computing for strategy security

- Combines Llama-3-405B for narrative analysis with lighter Mistral-7B for real-time execution

**Technical Approach:**

1. Scrapes social platforms (X, Discord, Telegram) for alpha signals
2. Processes on-chain data through EigenLayer-powered validators
3. Generates trade proposals using Monte Carlo simulations
4. Executes via MEV-protected transactions on Serum DEX

**Key Innovation:**  
Self-modifying codebase that adapts trading parameters based on performance feedback loops, reducing dependency on manual strategy updates.
