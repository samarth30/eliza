Privacy-preserving cloud computing.

## About Phala Network

Phala Network is a decentralized cloud computing platform specializing in **verifiable, privacy-preserving computation** for Web3 applications. It leverages **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** and blockchain technology to create a secure infrastructure for confidential smart contracts, AI workloads, and sensitive data processing. As a pioneer in confidential computing, Phala bridges the gap between trustless systems and enterprise-grade performance, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) without compromising speed or security.

**Main Products/Services**:

- **Phala Cloud**: A TEE-powered decentralized cloud platform for secure AI/blockchain workloads.
- **Phat Contracts**: Serverless smart contracts with privacy features, compatible with multiple blockchains.
- **TEE Clusters**: Secure computing nodes grouped for redundancy and fault tolerance.

**Web3 Significance**: Phala addresses critical challenges in decentralized AI, DeFi, and data privacy by providing a scalable alternative to traditional cloud services while maintaining cryptographic guarantees. Its integration with Polkadot enhances cross-chain interoperability for privacy-focused applications.

## Technology

**Core Stack**:

- **Intel TDX Enclaves**: Hardware-level isolation for tamper-proof computation.
- **Substrate Framework**: For blockchain interoperability (Polkadot ecosystem).
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secures data in transit and at rest.
- **Remote Attestation**: Proof of TEE integrity via cryptographic verification.

**Technical Approach**: Phala separates its blockchain layer (consensus) from its off-chain TEE worker network. Smart contracts execute in isolated enclaves, ensuring data remains encrypted even during processing. This allows:

- **Confidential Computation**: Secure execution of AI models, financial transactions, and private APIs.
- **1000x Cost Efficiency**: Compared to traditional trustless systems like zero-knowledge proofs.

**Problems Solved**:

- Mitigates centralized cloud risks (data leaks, vendor lock-in).
- Enables privacy-preserving DeFi, AI agent swarms, and cross-chain data sharing.

## Integration with Eliza

Phala Network provides **TEE-secured infrastructure** for ElizaOS agents, enabling:

- **Secure API Key Management**: Agents interact with external services (e.g., Twitter, blockchain networks) without exposing credentials.
- **On-Chain Transaction Privacy**: Execute swaps, transfers, or governance actions confidentially.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Eliza V2 Beta agents (launched March 2025) leverage Phala Cloud’s TEE clusters for swarm communication.

**Technical Synergy**:

- Phala’s updated `phala-cloud-cli` (March 2025) simplifies deployment of ElizaOS workflows.
- Joint development of **agent auditing frameworks** with GoPlus Security ensures verifiable AI behavior.

**Official Plugin**: The [ElizaOS-Phala Plugin](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/phala-tee) enables TEE-backed memory storage and document processing for agents, featured in the [Eliza starter kit](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter).
