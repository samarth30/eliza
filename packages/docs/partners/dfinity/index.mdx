Internet Computer blockchain for decentralized applications.

## About Dfinity

Dfinity Foundation develops the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a third-generation blockchain that reimagines internet infrastructure by enabling fully decentralized applications to run entirely on-chain. Its flagship product is the Internet Computer blockchain â€“ a public network combining decentralized governance, cryptographic security, and web-speed performance to host smart contracts, enterprise systems, and web services without traditional cloud infrastructure.

As a pioneer in Web3 infrastructure, ICP enables developers to build censorship-resistant social platforms, enterprise SaaS solutions, and blockchain-integrated DeFi protocols while eliminating server costs and middlemen. The network's unique architecture positions it as a foundational layer for building a decentralized internet alternative.

## Technology

The Internet Computer employs several groundbreaking technologies:

- **Chain Key Cryptography**: Enables single public key verification for entire blockchain interactions and trustless cross-chain integration
- **Canister Smart Contracts**: Scalable computational units supporting WebAssembly (Wasm) with autonomous storage and HTTP request handling
- **Network Nervous System (NNS)**: On-chain DAO governing protocol upgrades and network economics via ICP token holder voting
- **Reverse Gas Model**: Developers pre-pay computation costs (cycles), enabling free end-user interactions
- **Subnet Architecture**: Hierarchical blockchain structure allowing infinite horizontal scaling via node partitioning

Key technical differentiators include native Bitcoin/Ethereum integration through protocol-level bridges (ckBTC/ckETH), ability to serve web assets directly from blockchain storage, and &lt;10s finality times. The system solves blockchain's scalability trilemma while enabling full-stack decentralization.

## Key Features

1. **Infinite Scalability** via subnet partitioning and dynamic resource allocation
2. **Native Bitcoin DeFi** through ECDSA threshold signatures and direct UTXO management
3. **SNS DAOs** for algorithmic governance of decentralized applications
4. **Reverse Gas Model** enabling web2-like user experiences
5. **HTTPS Outcalls** allowing smart contracts to interact with external APIs
6. **Chain Fusion** architecture unifying BTC/ETH/Solana assets without bridges
7. **End-to-End Encryption** with secure vaults for private data storage

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin currently exists in Dfinity's public repositories, technical synergies emerge through:

- **Canister Communication**: Potential for Eliza services to interact with ICP smart contracts via candid interfaces
- **Identity Federation**: Integration with Internet Identity protocol for cross-platform authentication
- **BTC/ETH Gateway**: Leveraging ICP's native crypto integrations for Eliza's asset management
- **NNS Participation**: Eliza nodes could participate in network governance through ICP staking

The partnership could enable Eliza users to deploy decentralized backend services on ICP while maintaining web2-compatible frontends, combining Eliza's interface strengths with ICP's decentralized infrastructure.

## Recent Developments

- **2025 Elliptic Partnership**: Implementing compliance tools for institutional DeFi applications
- **Bitcoin L2 Expansion**: Full-suite BTC DeFi capabilities including lending/borrowing markets
- **SNS DAO Launchpad**: 127+ community-governed dapps deployed in 2024
- **Ethereum Fusion**: ckETH integration processing $400M+ transactions since 2024
- **Developer Growth**: 37% YOY increase in active developers (2023-2024)

Public roadmap targets enterprise adoption through enhanced privacy features and hybrid cloud-blockchain architectures over the next 24 months.
