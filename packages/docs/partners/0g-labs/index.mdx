Building the future of decentralized AI infrastructure.

## About 0G Labs

0G Labs is building the world's first decentralized AI operating system (deAIOS), serving as foundational infrastructure for scalable AI applications in Web3. The project combines modular blockchain architecture with specialized components for AI workloads, including:

- **0G Chain**: A high-performance modular blockchain separating consensus, execution, and storage layers
- **0G Storage Network**: Decentralized storage optimized for AI datasets and model weights
- **0G Compute Network**: Framework supporting AI inference, training, and data retrieval
- **0G DA**: Infinitely scalable data availability layer achieving 50 GB/second throughput

As pioneers of the "Artificial Intelligence Layer" concept, 0G enables previously impossible use cases like on-chain machine learning, autonomous AI agents, and verifiable AI inference - positioning it as critical infrastructure for the convergence of AI and Web3.

## Technology

0G's technical innovations focus on overcoming blockchain's limitations for AI applications:

1. **Modular Architecture**:

   - Separation of data storage (historical data) from data publishing (real-time availability)
   - Consensus sharding with shared validator staking across networks
   - ZK-proof integration for efficient state verification

2. **Data Availability Breakthrough**:

   - 50,000x faster and 100x cheaper than competitors
   - Programmable DA layer supporting multiple data types (model weights, inference proofs, etc.)

3. **AI-Optimized Infrastructure**:
   - Decentralized GPU marketplace for compute resources
   - On-chain model registry with version control
   - Verifiable inference engine using zkML

This architecture solves critical pain points including AI model scalability costs, trustless verification of AI outputs, and interoperability between AI services.

## Key Features

- **50 GB/second data throughput** - enables real-time AI operations on-chain
- **Sub-cent transaction costs** for AI model interactions
- **Consensus-as-a-Service** for L2/L3 chains through shared validator network
- **ZK-powered AI audit trails** for regulatory compliance
- **Interchain AI operability** through standardized API endpoints
- **Decentralized model marketplace** with usage-based micropayments
- **Enterprise-grade SLA guarantees** for uptime and performance

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin documentation currently exists in public repositories, the partnership likely leverages:

1. **Privacy-Preserving AI**:

   - Combining 0G's verifiable compute with Eliza's encrypted agent framework
   - Enabling private AI economies through zero-knowledge proofs

2. **Agent Infrastructure**:

   - Hosting Eliza's autonomous agents on 0G's decentralized compute network
   - Using 0G DA for secure agent-to-agent communication

3. **Shared Resource Pool**:
   - Eliza agents accessing 0G's decentralized GPU marketplace
   - Cross-ecosystem agent interoperability through standardized APIs

Technical synergies focus on creating accountable AI systems with provable data lineage and execution integrity.

## Recent Developments

- **Q1 2025**: Launched $88M Ecosystem Growth Program with initial $8.88M developer incentives
- **Q4 2024**: Partnered with Alibaba Cloud for hybrid web2/web3 AI deployments
- **Q3 2024**: Achieved 50,000 TPS in testnet for model inference transactions
- **Roadmap**: Mainnet launch scheduled Q2 2025 with focus on autonomous AI agents

## Market Position

- **Competitive Edge**: 50x more cost-efficient than Celestia/EigenDA for AI workloads
- **Key Partners**: Includes Chainlink, OP Labs, and AWS alongside Eliza
- **Adoption**: 300+ projects in ecosystem including AI DeFi protocols and inference marketplaces
- **Funding**: $35M pre-seed round led by Hack VC + $53M strategic round from Coinbase Ventures
