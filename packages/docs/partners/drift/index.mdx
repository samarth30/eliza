Decentralized perpetual futures exchange.

## About Drift

Drift Protocol is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange operating on Solana, leveraging the blockchain's high throughput and low transaction costs to deliver institutional-grade trading infrastructure. As the largest open-source derivatives protocol on Solana, it enables peer-to-peer trading of perpetual futures, spot markets, and swaps without intermediaries. Drift supports 30+ collateral types and offers up to 50x leverage, positioning itself as a critical DeFi primitive for leveraged trading, lending, and liquidity provision. Its hybrid model combines an on-chain order book with a dynamic automated market maker (DAMM) to optimize liquidity and minimize slippage.

## Technology

Drift's stack revolves around Solana's high-performance blockchain, enabling sub-second trade execution and sub-cent fees. Key innovations include:

- **Hybrid Liquidity Model**: Merges a decentralized limit order book (DLOB) with a virtual AMM (vAMM) to balance price discovery and capital efficiency.
- **Cross-Margin Accounts**: Allow traders to manage multiple positions using shared collateral, reducing capital fragmentation.
- **Backstop AMM Liquidity (BAL)**: A novel mechanism where liquidity providers use leveraged positions to deepen market liquidity while earning yield.
- **Decentralized Risk Engine**: Manages liquidation thresholds and funding rates algorithmically, eliminating centralized control.  
  This architecture solves liquidity fragmentation and high slippage issues common in on-chain exchanges, offering a CEX-like experience with DeFi-native custody.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Asset Collateral**: Trade using SOL, BTC, ETH, stablecoins, and meme coins like BONK/WIF as collateral.
- **Dynamic Funding Rates**: Auto-adjust based on market conditions to balance long/short positions.
- **Insurance Fund Staking**: Earn fees by staking assets in protocol-managed vaults.
- **Institutional Tools**: Sub-account structures, customizable slippage tolerance, and post-only orders.
- **Real-World Asset (RWA) Integration**: Supports collateralization using tokenized assets like Ondo's yield-bearing instruments.
- **Low-Latency Oracle**: Uses Pyth Network and Switchboard for &lt;500ms price feeds.

## Integration with Eliza

The integration enables ElizaOS users to execute trades, manage leveraged positions, and access Drift's liquidity directly through conversational AI interfaces. Technical synergies include:

- **API-Level Compatibility**: ElizaOS interacts with Drift's Solana program via Typescript/Python SDKs for order routing.
- **Risk Management Bridging**: Eliza's AI agents can auto-adjust Drift positions based on user-defined risk parameters (e.g., stop-loss triggers).
- **Unified Portfolio Dashboard**: Aggregates Drift positions with other DeFi activities within Eliza's interface.  
  A dedicated [Eliza Drift Plugin](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/drift) simplifies position monitoring and executes trades via natural language commands (e.g., "Open 5x long BTC-PERP with 10% portfolio allocation").

## Recent Developments

- **2024 Milestones**: Achieved $2.2B weekly volume records, integrated PYUSD and Ethena's USDe as collateral, and launched prediction markets via BET tokens.
- **RWA Expansion**: Partnered with Ondo Finance to allow tokenized treasury bills as margin collateral.
- **Governance Upgrade**: Transitioned to DRIFT token-based DAO governance with multi-branch voting structures.

## Market Position

Drift dominates Solana's derivatives sector, processing >$6B monthly volumeâ€”surpassing competitors like Mango Markets. Key differentiators include its hybrid liquidity model and cross-margin capabilities. Strategic partnerships span Oracle providers (Pyth), liquidity networks (Wormhole), and infrastructure projects (Jito). The protocol has >250,000 monthly active traders and $1.2B in total value locked (TVL).
