AI agent for Web3.

## About ELIZA

ELIZA is a pioneering force in decentralized AI agent development, created by Eliza Labs to bridge artificial intelligence with Web3 technologies. As the creator of ElizaOS – an open-source framework written in TypeScript – the project enables developers to build autonomous AI agents capable of interacting with blockchain networks, decentralized applications (dApps), and smart contracts. These agents perform advanced tasks like automated trading, social media management, and real-time blockchain data analysis while maintaining full user control over their behavior and decision-making processes.

The platform's flagship product, _Eliza Wakes Up_, demonstrates its capabilities through emotionally intelligent AI companions that engage in contextual conversations, execute Web3 transactions, and operate across 15+ digital platforms. With over 50 plugins available for blockchain networks like Hedera and Flow, Eliza has become the first framework to achieve seamless interoperability between multi-agent AI systems and decentralized technologies.

## Technology

Eliza's architecture combines:

- **TypeScript-based runtime** for agent execution
- **Modular plugin system** supporting Web3 protocols (Hedera, Flow) and AI models (Llama 3, Claude 3)
- **LangGraph-based supervision** for multi-agent coordination
- **RAG-enhanced memory** using vector databases
- **On-chain interaction layer** for smart contract execution

The system solves critical Web3 adoption challenges by enabling:

1. Automated smart contract deployment/management
2. Real-time blockchain data analysis through natural language
3. Cross-platform agent interoperability (Discord ↔ DeFi protocols ↔ DAO governance)
4. Privacy-preserving AI operations via decentralized storage

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform agents** controlling Discord servers, Telegram bots, and X/Twitter accounts simultaneously
- **Model-agnostic AI core** supporting local LLMs and cloud APIs
- **Media processing pipeline** handling PDF analysis, image generation, and video transcription
- **Autonomous Web3 operations** including token swaps, NFT minting, and DAO voting
- **Human-in-the-loop controls** for critical financial transactions
- **Decentralized agent governance** through token-weighted decision making
- **Real-time blockchain listeners** triggering AI actions on specific contract events

## Integration with Eliza

## Recent Developments

- **April 2025**: Launched Auto.fun platform democratizing AI agent creation for non-technical users
- **March 2025**: Released Hedera Consensus Service plugin for decentralized agent coordination
- **February 2025**: Introduced Flow blockchain integration with Cadence smart contract support
- **January 2025**: Open-sourced core framework under MIT license, gaining 2.8k GitHub stars in first month

Public roadmap includes:

- Q3 2025: Agent-to-agent marketplace for skill trading
- Q4 2025: ZK-proof verifiable agent decision making
- 2026: Physical robotics integration through IOTA Tangle

## Market Position

Eliza dominates the Web3 agent niche with:

- **300% faster** blockchain interaction speeds vs. LangChain
- **47%** market share in DeFi automation tools
- Partnerships with Hedera, Flow, and Polygon
- **127,000+** developer community members

Key differentiators:

- Only framework with native social media ↔ DeFi arbitrage capabilities
- Lowest latency blockchain listeners (200ms confirmation-to-action)
- White-label agent deployment for enterprise Web3 services
