Decentralized privacy infrastructure.

## About Nillion

Nillion is a decentralized secure computation network designed to process sensitive data without decryption, leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques like **multi-party computation (MPC)** and **homomorphic encryption (HE)**. Its infrastructure enables blind computation, allowing third parties to perform operations on encrypted data while preserving privacy. The network serves as a foundational layer for privacy-preserving applications across industries such as AI, healthcare, finance, and identity management.

Nillion’s main offerings include:

- **Blind Modules**: Pre-configured privacy-enhancing computation clusters for developers.
- **nilChain**: A coordination layer for network governance, staking, and transaction processing.
- **Petnet**: Orchestration tools to combine various privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like MPC, HE, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

In Web3, Nillion addresses critical gaps in handling high-value data (HVD) by decentralizing trust for sensitive computations, positioning itself as a privacy infrastructure layer complementary to blockchain networks.

## Technology

Nillion’s stack combines cutting-edge cryptographic primitives and distributed systems:

- **Blind Computation**: Executes operations on encrypted data without decryption, using MPC to split data across nodes and HE for computations on ciphertext.
- **Modular Architecture**: Blind Modules can be deployed across independent clusters with customizable configurations (security thresholds, node count, hardware specs).
- **Hybrid PET Integration**: Seamlessly combines MPC, HE, and ZKPs to optimize for specific use cases (e.g., speed for AI inference, robustness for financial modeling).

This approach solves the **decrypt-compute-re-encrypt vulnerability** in traditional systems, enabling secure collaboration on sensitive datasets while eliminating single points of trust.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: Train and infer models on encrypted healthcare, genomic, or financial data.
- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: MPC-based architecture future-proofed against quantum attacks.
- **Decentralized Clusters**: Data distributed across nodes globally, with no single entity controlling decryption.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Enables GDPR/HIPAA-compliant data sharing for enterprises.
- **Cross-Industry Use Cases**: Supports dark pools, private credit scoring, secure genomic analysis, and decentralized identity.
- **Interoperability**: Integrates with blockchains and off-chain systems via APIs.
- **Developer Tools**: SDKs for building custom Blind Modules and PET workflows.

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin is documented in public sources, the partnership likely leverages Nillion’s APIs to enable:

- **Secure Data Storage**: Eliza users can store credentials, health records, or financial data on Nillion’s network.
- **Blind Computation Services**: ElizaOS apps might interface with Nillion’s clusters for privacy-preserving AI inference or analytics.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Cross-platform authentication using zero-knowledge proofs managed via Nillion’s PETs.

Technical synergies focus on combining Eliza’s user-facing applications with Nillion’s backend privacy infrastructure, enabling novel use cases like private portfolio management or healthcare diagnostics within the Eliza ecosystem.

## Recent Developments

- **Mainnet Launch**: Operational since 2024, supporting projects like Ritual (blind AI) and Monadic DNA (genomic analytics).
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Over 35 confirmed partners, including Aloha AI (dating app privacy) and Salt (confidential financial comparisons).
- **Token Launch**: NIL token debuted on CoinList in March 2025, with a $750M FDV at launch.
- **Apple Alignment**: Publicly cited as aligning with Apple’s vision for private AI, though Nillion emphasizes decentralized trust over hardware enclaves.
- **Roadmap Focus**: Expanding Petnet’s orchestration capabilities and improving tooling for developers.

## Market Position

Nillion occupies a unique niche as a **privacy compute layer**, differentiating from transaction-focused chains (Zcash, Monero) and co-processors (Chainlink, Alephium). Competitors include Secret Network and Oasis, but Nillion’s PET-agnostic architecture offers broader applicability.

**Key Partnerships**:

- **Ritual**: Decentralized AI inference.
- **Soarchain**: Processed 130M+ privacy-preserved IoT data points.
- **Aloha**: Privacy-first dating app infrastructure.

Adoption metrics remain undisclosed, but the network has attracted enterprises in regulated sectors like healthcare and finance.
