## About Nillion

Nillion is a decentralized secure computation network processing sensitive data without decryption using multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE). It enables blind computation where third parties can perform operations on encrypted data while preserving privacy. The infrastructure serves as a privacy layer for applications in AI, healthcare, finance, and identity management.

Key offerings:

- **Blind Modules**: Pre-configured privacy computation clusters
- **nilChain**: Coordination layer for governance, staking, and transactions
- **Petnet**: Orchestration tools combining various privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin is documented publicly, the partnership likely enables:

- Secure storage of credentials, health records, and financial data
- Privacy-preserving AI inference and analytics
- Decentralized identity with zero-knowledge proofs

## Recent Developments

- Mainnet launched in 2024, supporting projects like Ritual and Monadic DNA
- 35+ confirmed partners including Aloha AI and Salt
- NIL token launched on CoinList (March 2025, $750M FDV)
- Aligned with Apple's private AI vision but emphasizes decentralized trust
- Expanding Petnet capabilities and developer tooling

## Market Position

Positioned as a privacy compute layer, distinct from transaction-focused chains and co-processors. Notable partnerships include Ritual (decentralized AI), Soarchain (130M+ privacy-preserved IoT data points), and Aloha (dating app).
