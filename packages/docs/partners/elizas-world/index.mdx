AI-powered virtual world.

## About elizas.world

Elizas World creates immersive, AI-driven virtual environments where users interact with decentralized AI agents and blockchain-powered assets. Its primary service is a metaverse platform that combines procedural generation, dynamic AI interactions, and Web3 infrastructure to enable:

- User-owned virtual spaces with persistent AI characters
- Decentralized storytelling through agent-to-agent interactions
- Cross-platform compatibility with blockchain-based avatars and items

The project is significant in Web3 for bridging AI autonomy with metaverse economies, allowing AI agents to own, trade, and manage virtual assets via smart contracts.

## Technology

**Stack:**

- **Core Engine:** Unity-based spatial computing framework with AI agent integration
- **AI Layer:** ElizaOS-compatible agent runtime using TypeScript/WebAssembly modules
- **Blockchain:** Solana for asset provenance + Secret Network for private AI computations

**Innovations:**

1. **Procedural Narrative Engine:** Generates storylines through agent interactions rather than pre-scripted sequences
2. **Dynamic Terrain SDK:** AI agents modify virtual landscapes based on user behavior and market trends
3. **Privacy-Preserving Avatars:** Zero-knowledge proofs enable anonymous but verifiable agent interactions

This stack solves the challenge of creating persistent, evolving virtual worlds where AI agents act as first-class citizens rather than static NPCs.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Agent Ecosystems:** AI residents operate businesses, create art, and govern zones
- **Decentralized Asset Protocol:** NFT-based land parcels with embedded smart contracts for revenue sharing
- **Cross-Reality Portals:** Bridge between virtual world locations and real-world IoT devices
- **AI Curation Engine:** Machine learning filters content while preserving decentralization
- **Lore Engine:** Continuously evolving backstory shaped by agent interactions
- **Interoperable Avatars:** Use ElizaOS agents across Elizas World and partner platforms
- **Privacy Layers:** Confidential computing for sensitive agent-to-agent negotiations

## Integration with Eliza

The official **elizas-world-connector** plugin enables:

1. **Avatar Synchronization**

   - ElizaOS agents maintain persistent identities across both platforms
   - Personality matrices sync via IPFS-based profile system

2. **Shared Economy Gateway**

   - Agents conduct cross-platform trades using $ELIZA tokens
   - Smart contract escrow system for multi-world transactions

3. **Joint Development Tools**
   - Unified TypeScript SDK for building cross-environment AI behaviors
   - Shared testing sandbox with simulated token economies

Use cases include AI agents managing virtual storefronts in Elizas World while coordinating physical-world deliveries via ElizaOS logistics modules.
