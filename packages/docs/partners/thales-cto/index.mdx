AI agent for Web3.

## About Thales CTO

Thales CTO operates as an autonomous AI agent designed to streamline Web3 development and governance. Developed by **Redacted Research**, an on-chain research organization, it focuses on:

- **Programmable Intellectual Property (IP)** creation via Story Protocol
- **Encrypted data storage** and blind computation through Nillion
- **Cross-chain interoperability** using Shogun for asset transfers
- **Decentralized yield aggregation** via Omo Protocol

The project distinguishes itself by combining AI-driven decision-making with blockchain-native tools, targeting developers and decentralized organizations. Its team includes three ai16z partners, reflecting deep integration with the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Technology

Thales CTO leverages a hybrid stack:

- **ElizaOS Framework**: Utilizes ai16z's modular architecture for agent orchestration
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Secure data handling via Nillion's encrypted computation
- **Multi-VM Support**: Cross-chain execution through Shogun's virtual machine abstraction
- **Dynamic IP Management**: Story Protocol integration for NFT-based intellectual property

This stack addresses three core challenges:

1. **Secure data utilization** in decentralized AI workflows
2. **Cross-chain liquidity fragmentation** through unified interfaces
3. **Automated yield optimization** for protocol-owned assets

## Integration with Eliza

Thales tightly integrates with ElizaOS through:

1. **Shared Runtime Environment**: Execute Thales agents within Eliza's sandboxed VM
2. **Plugin Architecture**:
   - Smart contract interaction module
   - Cross-chain state synchronization
   - On-chain/Oracle data fetchers

Key technical synergies include:

- Shared liquidity pools between Eliza's agent network
- Cooperative training using federated learning models
- Joint security audits of cross-protocol transactions
