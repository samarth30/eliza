Building the future of decentralized AI.

## About Allora Labs

Allora Labs develops infrastructure for decentralized artificial intelligence through its flagship project, the **Allora Network**—a self-improving, context-aware AI network built on blockchain. The network aggregates insights from distributed AI models to produce superior inferences compared to centralized alternatives. Key offerings include machine learning model deployment infrastructure, verifiable AI tooling (like zkML), and an ecosystem supporting AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) in DeFi, DAOs, and predictive analytics. As a leader in AI x Web3 convergence, Allora Labs addresses critical gaps in trust, transparency, and collective intelligence for on-chain applications.

## Technology

**Core stack:**

- **Decentralized Inference Synthesis**: Combines outputs from multiple AI models using context-aware forecasting, where models predict each other’s performance under current conditions to optimize results.
- **Cosmos L1 Blockchain**: Utilizes a permissionless Proof-of-Stake layer-1 chain with CometBFT consensus for decentralized coordination.
- **Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML)**: Enables cryptographically verifiable AI inferences through collaborations like the zkPredictor.
- **Federated Learning**: Models improve iteratively by learning from real-world feedback and peer outputs without centralized data pooling.

**Key innovations:**

- Reduces prediction errors by 30-50% compared to monolithic AI models through collaborative intelligence.
- Solves centralization risks, data silos, and opaque decision-making in traditional AI systems.

## Key Features

- **Self-improving network**: Models evolve via continuous peer learning and real-world performance feedback.
- **Context-aware forecasting**: AI agents dynamically weight contributions based on situational relevance.
- **Token-curated security**: ALLO tokens incentivize high-quality inferences and secure the network through staking.
- **Privacy-preserving AI**: zkML integration ensures confidential model operations for sensitive use cases.
- **Cross-chain interoperability**: Native support for Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos ecosystems.
- **Low-latency inference**: Sub-2-second response times for time-sensitive applications like DeFi trading.

## Integration with Eliza

The partnership focuses on:

1. **Secure AI Agents**: Allora’s zkML technology enables ElizaOS agents to execute verifiable, privacy-preserving transactions (e.g., confidential DeFi strategies).
2. **Decentralized Intelligence Layer**: Eliza agents leverage Allora’s network for market sentiment analysis, price predictions, and risk modeling.
3. **Joint Tooling**: Shared developer resources include the _zkPredictor_ for on-chain forecast verification and a cross-chain oracle system.
4. **Plugin Ecosystem**: While no standalone Allora plugin exists, core functionalities are embedded in ElizaOS’s agent SDK through API-level integration.
