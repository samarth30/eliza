Web3 infrastructure.

## About Fleek

Fleek operates at the intersection of Web3 infrastructure and AI agent development, offering an open-source platform for deploying decentralized applications and autonomous AI systems. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in New York, the company has raised $25M in Series A funding to build critical infrastructure for the decentralized web. Its core mission centers on abstracting Web3 complexities while enhancing performance through novel edge computing solutions.

Key offerings include:

- **Fleek Network**: A decentralized edge computing layer for low-latency content delivery (CDN), server-side rendering, and verifiable compute
- **Fleek.xyz**: A protocol-agnostic development platform supporting 300,000+ deployments with IPFS/Filecoin storage, ENS management, and serverless functions
- **AI Agent Infrastructure**: Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-enabled deployment of AI agents with auto-scaling capabilities

## Technology

Fleek combines several technical innovations:

- **Decentralized Edge Network**: A global node network (3,000+ nodes) optimized for less than 200ms latency using geo-aware routing
- **Trusted Execution Environments**: Enables verifiable computation for AI agents while maintaining performance parity with centralized clouds
- **Protocol-Agnostic Architecture**: Supports Ethereum, Solana, Filecoin, and Arweave through modular service integrations
- **Hybrid Infrastructure**: Bridges Web2 performance (sub-second responses) with Web3 principles through:
  - Dynamic content acceleration
  - ZK-proof compatible compute
  - Decentralized database orchestration

This stack addresses critical Web3 bottlenecks - 94% faster content delivery vs raw IPFS and 60% cost reduction compared to traditional CDNs through decentralized resource pooling.

## Key Features

- 1. **One-Click AI Agent Deployment**: Deploy Eliza-compatible agents in a few minutes with pre-configured TEE security
- 2. **Cross-Protocol Storage**: Unified interface for IPFS, Arweave, and Filecoin with automatic content addressing
- 3. **Decentralized Serverless Compute**: Execute verified logic at edge nodes with pay-per-use pricing
- 4. **Dynamic Web3 CDN**: Accelerate both static assets and API responses through geo-distributed caching
- 5. **Censorship-Resistant Hosting**: Deploy frontends with automatic ENS/DNS management and IPNS updates
- 6. **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to on-chain triggers through native smart contract monitoring
- 7. **Zero-Knowledge Compute**: Process sensitive data in TEE-secured environments with optional proof generation

## Integration with Eliza

Fleek provides first-class support for ElizaOS through:

- **Official Plugin System**: The `elizaos-fleek` plugin enables:

  - Direct deployment of agent logic to Fleek Network
  - Automatic secret management via TEE-secured environments
  - Cross-chain event listening through native queue systems

- **Shared Resource Pooling**: Eliza agents can leverage Fleek's decentralized storage for knowledge bases and Fleek Network for low-latmetry inference

- **Joint Use Cases**:
  - Deploying privacy-preserving AI agents with verifiable computation proofs
  - Hosting agent UIs on censorship-resistant infrastructure
  - Using Fleek's edge nodes for real-time agent response acceleration

## Recent Developments

- **2025 Community Sale**: Ongoing initiative to decentralize network governance through community-owned nodes
- **AI Agent Marketplace**: Launched beta platform for discovering/preconfiguring 150+ agent templates
- **Fleek Network v2**: Upgraded consensus mechanism achieving 12,000 TPS for edge compute operations
- **Zero-Knowledge CDN**: Confidential content delivery system combining TEEs with zk-SNARKs

Public roadmap highlights include decentralized database services (Q3 2025) and integration with Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol for enhanced network security.

## Market Position

As the first mover in Web3 edge computing, Fleek competes with:

| **Aspect**       | **Fleek**               | **Traditional Cloud** |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Archival Storage | $0.07/GB (Filecoin)     | $0.23/GB (S3)         |
| Compute Latency  | 140-200ms (Global Edge) | 300-800ms (Regional)  |
| Censorship Risk  | Protocol-Governed       | Corporate-Controlled  |

Notable partnerships include Filecoin for storage primitives, ENS for naming services, and Polygon for L2 compute offloading. The platform serves 40,000+ monthly active developers with 93% retention rate.
