Web3 infrastructure.

## About Hyperfy

Hyperfy is a browser-based metaverse platform enabling users to create, own, and interact with immersive 3D virtual worlds accessible across devices, including VR headsets. Built on Ethereum, its core offering is a virtual world engine that prioritizes accessibility through features like no-code creation tools and AI-powered navigation. The platform launched its native HYPER token in January 2025, emphasizing community governance and decentralized ownership. Hyperfy distinguishes itself by eliminating artificial scarcity models, instead focusing on open-world creation and interoperability within Web3 ecosystems.

## Technology

- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism networks via its `useEth()` React hook for seamless smart contract interactions[^6]
- **AI Agents**: Implements AI-driven navigation assistants and responsive environmental systems
- **Web-Based Engine**: Leverages React framework for browser-first 3D rendering without native app requirements
- **Decentralized Storage**: Worlds and assets stored on IPFS with Ethereum-based ownership verification
- **Cross-Platform VRM**: Full support for VRM avatars with blockchain-authenticated customization

This stack addresses metaverse accessibility challenges by enabling:

1. Browser-based creation/accessibility across mobile/desktop/VR
2. Low-latency multi-user interactions via distributed architecture
3. Secure NFT integration without centralized marketplaces

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Worlds**: Deploy conversational agents and smart environment responders
- **Gasless Minting**: Create NFT assets without upfront ETH costs
- **Governance Staking**: HYPER token holders vote on protocol upgrades
- **Cross-Environment Portals**: Seamless transitions between interconnected worlds
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing with version control
- **Dynamic Asset Pipeline**: Import 3D models, audio, and video with auto-optimization
- **Monetization Tools**: Built-in token gating and paywalled content systems

## Integration with Eliza

Hyperfy's official ElizaOS plugin enables:

- **AI Agent Deployment**: Embed Eliza personalities as NPCs or environment controllers
- **Cross-Platform Memory**: Persistent AI character states across multiple worlds
- **Voice Interaction**: Natural language processing for voice-driven world navigation
- **Automated Content Generation**: Dynamic world expansion via Eliza's text-to-3D pipelines

Technical synergies include shared authentication using Ethereum wallets and joint development of the Hyperbolic inference layer for real-time AI rendering[^7]. Users benefit from intelligent world-building assistants and context-aware AI guides that adapt to individual behavior patterns.

## Recent Developments

- **v2 Launch (Jan 2025)**: Open-sourced engine core with free world creation
- **HYPER Token Release**: Launched Jan 6, 2025 with $6.7M FDV
- **Eliza Labs Partnership**: Integrated AI agents into world logic systems
- **VRM Avatar Standardization**: Full-body expression support across 120+ worlds
- **Upcoming**: No-code toolkit for visual scripting (Q2 2025 roadmap)

## Market Position

**Competitive Edge**:

- vs Decentraland: Browser-native vs plugin-dependent
- vs Cryptovoxels: Advanced AI integration vs static worlds
- vs Spatial: Open-source engine vs proprietary stack

**Key Partners**:

- Eliza Labs (AI infrastructure)
- Hyperbolic (GPU compute for AI rendering)
- VRM Consortium (avatar standards)

Adoption metrics include 443M HYPER tokens in circulation and 3,269 active governance participants. Over 10,000 worlds created since v2 launch, with 78% community bullish sentiment per internal polls[^2].
