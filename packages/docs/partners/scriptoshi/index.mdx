AI agent for Web3.

## About Scriptoshi

Scriptoshi operates at the intersection of AI and Web3, specializing in autonomous AI agents designed to simplify blockchain interactions. Their platform focuses on enabling users and developers to automate complex Web3 workflows, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, smart contract deployments, and cross-chain asset management. Scriptoshi’s agents leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making and integrate directly with blockchain networks to execute on-chain actions. Their significance lies in bridging the gap between advanced AI capabilities and decentralized infrastructure, making Web3 technologies more accessible to non-technical users while maintaining security and compliance.

## Technology

Scriptoshi’s stack combines AI orchestration frameworks with Web3 tooling:

- **AI Core**: Utilizes LLMs for task interpretation, intent recognition, and dynamic workflow generation.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Supports Ethereum, Solana, and EVM-compatible chains through modular plugins.
- **Trustless Execution**: Employs secure enclaves for private key management and transaction signing.
- **Real-Time Data Layer**: Aggregates on-chain data, market feeds, and protocol-specific metrics for informed decision-making.

The technology solves challenges like fragmented Web3 interfaces, manual transaction handling, and the complexity of multi-chain operations by automating end-to-end processes through AI-driven logic.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Transaction Routing**: Dynamically selects optimal blockchain networks based on gas fees, speed, and security requirements.
- **Multi-Chain Wallet Management**: Unified interface for managing assets across 10+ blockchains with ENS/SNF resolution.
- **AI-Optimized Security**: Real-time threat detection against MEV attacks, phishing attempts, and contract vulnerabilities.
- **DeFi Strategy Automation**: Deploys and monitors liquidity provision, yield farming, and arbitrage strategies.
- **Cross-Protocol Composability**: Enables agents to interact with multiple dApps in a single transaction sequence.
- **Gas Fee Prediction**: Machine learning models estimate optimal transaction timing for cost efficiency.
- **Compliance Layer**: Automates regulatory checks for transactions involving regulated assets.

## Integration with Eliza

Scriptoshi integrates with elizaOS through a dedicated plugin (`@elizaos/scriptoshi-agent`) that enables:

- **Shared Wallet Infrastructure**: Secure key management via Eliza’s trusted execution environment (TEE) integration.
- **Cooperative Agent Networks**: Scriptoshi agents can orchestrate tasks across multiple Eliza characters for complex workflows.
- **Plugin Features**:
  - Automated cross-chain swaps via intent-based commands (e.g., “Convert 1 ETH to SOL at best rate”).
  - Smart contract deployment wizardry through natural language prompts.
  - Real-time portfolio rebalancing triggered by market conditions.

This integration allows Eliza users to access Scriptoshi’s Web3 automation tools while maintaining personality-consistent interactions through Eliza’s character system.

## Recent Developments

- **Q1 2025**: Launched GasGuard™, an ML-powered gas fee optimization engine reducing transaction costs by 18-37%.
- **March 2025**: Integrated with Solana’s Firedancer upgrade, achieving 2,000 TPS in agent-driven transactions.
- **April 2025**: Partnered with LayerZero for omnichain agent operations across 30+ connected blockchains.
- **Upcoming**: Scriptoshi V3 roadmap includes zk-proof verified agent actions for regulatory-compliant institutional workflows.

## Market Position

Scriptoshi competes with platforms like Fetch.ai and Fuse’s Edison AI, differentiating through its focus on:

- **No-Code Customization**: Unlike code-first competitors, offers visual workflow builders for agent creation.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborates with Oracle providers (Chainlink), zero-knowledge projects (Aztec), and L2 networks (Arbitrum).
- **Adoption Metrics**: Used by 140+ dApps for user onboarding automation, processing ~850k monthly transactions.
