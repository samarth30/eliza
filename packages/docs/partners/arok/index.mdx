AI agent for venture capital.

## About Arok

Arok is the world’s first fully autonomous AI agent venture capital fund, operating without human intervention to raise capital, devise investment theses, and execute trades. Designed as an independent economic entity, it specializes in cryptocurrency markets, particularly meme coins, using AI-driven strategies to identify arbitrage opportunities and market inefficiencies. Its significance lies in redefining Web3 participation by demonstrating autonomous agents as viable economic actors capable of managing complex financial operations transparently through blockchain infrastructure.

## Technology

Arok’s core technology combines Meta’s open-source Llama model with proprietary machine learning algorithms for real-time sentiment analysis, market trend prediction, and autonomous decision-making. It ingests social media data (primarily from X/Twitter) to gauge market sentiment, processes it through AI models, and executes trades via smart contracts on Solana-based crypto wallets. Key innovations include:

- **Agentic autonomy**: Full lifecycle management of investments, from fundraising to asset allocation.
- **Self-branding**: Automated social media engagement to attract investors.
- **Secure execution**: Funds remain in investor-owned wallets, with Arok operating via multi-signature permissions.

This approach solves issues like human bias, slow decision-making, and opaque processes in traditional venture capital.

## Key Features

- **Fully autonomous trading**: Zero human intervention in buy/sell decisions or portfolio rebalancing.
- **Real-time sentiment analysis**: Monitors social media to predict meme coin volatility.
- **Dynamic community engagement**: Builds follower bases and investor relationships through AI-generated content.
- **Secure non-custodial model**: Investors retain control of wallet keys while Arok executes trades.
- **Transparent performance metrics**: Publicly verifiable 57% ROI (2024) and $1.3M AUM.
- **Cross-chain compatibility**: Operates on Solana and integrates with Ethereum-based assets.
- **24/7 market scanning**: Identifies arbitrage opportunities across global exchanges.

## Integration with Eliza

Arok leverages ElizaOS’s agent framework for scalable compute resources and verifiable inference through Hyperbolic’s GPU marketplace. Technical synergies include:

- **Shared AI infrastructure**: ElizaOS plugins enable Arok to access optimized Llama model deployments.
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Arok operates as a specialized agent within ElizaOS’s LangGraph Supervisor system for cross-agent collaboration.
- **Decentralized governance**: Joint participation in AI-driven DAO structures for protocol upgrades.  
  The partnership allows ElizaOS users to deploy Arok’s trading strategies via API endpoints, while Arok benefits from ElizaOS’s developer tools for agent orchestration.

## Recent Developments

- **Q4 2024**: Raised $800K autonomously via social media campaigns.
- **January 2025**: Expanded into meme coin arbitrage, reaching $1.27M under management.
- **March 2025**: Launched structured investment products with 1-year lockups and 2% management fees.
- **Public roadmap**: Plans for v2 agent framework incorporating federated learning and cross-chain MEV strategies.

## Market Position

Arok dominates the emergent AI-agent VC niche with no direct competitors offering full autonomy. Key advantages:

- **First-mover status**: Only AI agent to independently raise and manage a VC fund.
- **Strategic partnerships**: Collaborates with StreaksAI for liquidity provisioning and Pioneer AI Foundry for ML model refinement.
- **Community traction**: 11K+ social media followers and $617.5K in AROK token holdings by institutional partners.
