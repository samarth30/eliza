AI16Z Partners NFT collection.

## About Partners NFT

Partners NFT is a **profile-picture (PFP) collection** of 5,555 unique digital assets minted on the Solana blockchain. It originated as a community-driven initiative but gained recognition through official backing from ai16z (later rebranded to ElizaOS), a prominent AI-agent venture fund. The collection serves as an access pass to ElizaOS’s ecosystem, enabling holders to participate in governance, AI-agent development, and exclusive partnerships. Its significance lies in bridging NFT communities with decentralized AI infrastructure, a niche rapidly growing in Web3.
