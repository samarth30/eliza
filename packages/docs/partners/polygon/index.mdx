Layer 2 scaling solution.

## About Polygon

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a leading Layer 2 scaling solution and multi-chain ecosystem designed to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and usability. Its core mission is to create an interconnected network of Ethereum-compatible blockchains through modular frameworks and zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. Key offerings include:

- **Polygon PoS**: A proof-of-stake sidechain handling ~7,000 transactions per second with sub-2-second finality
- **Polygon zkEVM**: A ZK-rollup achieving Ethereum-equivalent security while reducing transaction costs by 90%
- **Chain Development Kit (CDK)**: Open-source toolkit to launch customizable ZK-powered Layer 2 chains

As the first major Ethereum scaling solution to surpass 1 billion total transactions, Polygon powers 50,000+ decentralized applications and secures $5B+ in assets. Founded in 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun, it has become foundational infrastructure for Web3 development.

## Technology

Polygon’s tech stack combines multiple scaling approaches:

- **Hybrid PoS Sidechains**: Decentralized validators process transactions off Ethereum mainnet while periodically committing checkpoints for finality
- **ZK-Proof Systems**: zkEVM uses advanced cryptographic proofs to validate transaction batches while maintaining EVM bytecode compatibility
- **Modular Framework**: Developers can mix-and-match components like consensus layers and data availability solutions
- **Interoperability Protocol**: Native bridges enable cross-chain asset transfers between Ethereum, Polygon chains, and external networks

This architecture solves Ethereum’s scalability trilemma by offering:

- Transaction fees under $0.01
- 2-second block times
- Full EVM/Solidity compatibility
- Inherited Ethereum security through frequent state commitments

## Key Features

- 1. **Multi-Chain Scaling**: Supports standalone chains, ZK rollups, and optimized sidechains
- 2. **Ethereum Tooling Parity**: Works with MetaMask, Truffle, Hardhat, and all EVM development tools
- 3. **Enterprise-Grade Throughput**: Processes 4-8x more transactions per second than Ethereum mainnet
- 4. **Enhanced Privacy**: Optional zk-SNARKs for confidential transactions
- 5. **Gasless Transactions**: Sponsored fee meta-transactions for dApp users
- 6. **Plasma Security**: Fraud proofs and exit mechanisms for bridge security
- 7. **Polygon ID**: Decentralized identity framework with ZK-based credentials

## Integration with Eliza

The ElizaOS-Polygon integration centers on three technical pillars:

1. **On-Chain AI Agents**: A dedicated plugin (github.com/elizaos-plugins/polygon-agent) enables autonomous AI agents to:

   - Execute contract interactions via Solidity bindings
   - Monitor chain state through customized RPC endpoints
   - Automate cross-chain operations using Polygon Bridges

2. **Co-Developed Infrastructure**:

   - Custom zkOracle for verifiable off-chain data feeds
   - Gasless relayer service for agent transactions
   - MEV-resistant transaction bundler

3. **Joint Grant Program**:
   - $1M POL fund for AI-agent development
   - Shared validator nodes offering prioritized block space
   - Native support for agent reward streams through Superfluid payments

Use cases include DeFi yield optimizers that simultaneously interact with Aave/Polygon and Uniswap/Ethereum, and NFT agents managing cross-chain portfolios.

## Recent Developments

- **Toposware Acquisition** (2024): Enhanced ZK research capabilities
- **Elderberry Upgrade** (2025): Reduced zkEVM proof generation time by 40%
- **Testnet Expansion**: Launched dedicated testnets for account abstraction and decentralized sequencers
- **ElizaOS Grant Program** (2025): Largest AI-focused ecosystem fund in Web3
- **2025 Roadmap**: Plans for unified liquidity layer across all Polygon chains

## Market Position

As the most adopted Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon dominates with:

- **4.6M Daily Transactions** (7x Arbitrum’s volume)
- **$1.2B TVL** across DeFi protocols
- **64% Market Share** among EVM-compatible L2s

Strategic partnerships include integrations with:

- **Aave**: Largest DeFi deployment with $900M in liquidity
- **OpenSea**: Preferred NFT minting platform
- **Stripe**: Fiat-to-crypto onramps
- **Dolce & Gabbana**: Luxury NFT collaborations
