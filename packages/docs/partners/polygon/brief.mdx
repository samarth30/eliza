# Polygon Overview

## Core Technology

- Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum using modular frameworks and zero-knowledge technology
- Key products:
  - Polygon PoS: Proof-of-stake sidechain (~7,000 TPS, less than 2s finality)
  - Polygon zkEVM: ZK-rollup with Ethereum security and 90% lower costs
  - Chain Development Kit (CDK): Open-source toolkit for ZK-powered L2 chains
- First scaling solution exceeding 1B transactions, supporting 50,000+ dApps, securing $5B+ assets
- Founded 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun

## ElizaOS Integration

- Technical components:
  1. On-Chain AI Agents: Plugin enables contract interaction, chain monitoring, cross-chain operations
  2. Co-developed zkOracle, gasless relayer service, MEV-resistant bundler
  3. $1M POL grant fund for AI-agent development with shared validator nodes
- Use cases: Cross-chain DeFi optimizers, NFT portfolio management agents

## Recent Developments

- Toposware acquisition (2024) for ZK research
- Elderberry Upgrade (2025): 40% faster zkEVM proofs
- Testnet expansion for account abstraction and decentralized sequencers
- ElizaOS Grant Program (2025)
- 2025 Roadmap: Unified liquidity layer across Polygon chains
