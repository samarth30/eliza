Layer 1 blockchain platform.

## About TON Network

TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain platform initially developed by Telegram founders Pavel and Nikolai Durov. Now maintained by the open-source community through the TON Foundation, it aims to create a scalable, user-friendly ecosystem for decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 services. Its architecture supports unlimited sharding, enabling high-throughput transactions while maintaining low fees. Key components include:

- **TON Blockchain**: A high-speed base layer with dynamic sharding
- **TON DNS**: Decentralized domain name system for .ton addresses
- **TON Storage**: Distributed file storage network
- **TON Services**: Framework for decentralized apps and smart contracts

As one of the few blockchains natively integrated with a major messaging platform (Telegram), TON positions itself as a gateway for mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, prioritizing accessibility for 500M+ potential users.

## Technology

### Architecture

TON employs a **multi-chain hierarchical structure**:

1. **Masterchain**: Maintains network metadata and validator sets
2. **Workchains**: Parallel chains handling specialized tasks (up to 2³²)
3. **Shardchains**: Subdivided chains within workchains (up to 2⁶⁰)

This enables:

- **Dynamic sharding** for horizontal scaling (claims of 5M+ TPS)
- **Hypercube routing** for cross-chain communication
- **Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) Proof-of-Stake** consensus

## Key Features

1. **Telegram Integration**: Native wallet bot (@wallet) for 900M+ users
2. **Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps**: Built-in DEX functionality with instant settlement
3. **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Censorship-resistant DNS, storage, and proxy services
4. **Developer-Friendly SDKs**: Rust/C++ tooling with TON Labs support
5. **On-Chain Governance**: Protocol upgrades via validator voting
6. **NFT Standard Support**: Native tokenomics for digital collectibles
7. **Institutional-Grade Security**: Formal verification for smart contracts

## Integration with Eliza

While no official ElizaOS plugin is publicly documented in TON repositories, technical synergy exists through:

- **Wallet API Compatibility**: TON's JS SDK enables direct asset management within ElizaOS interfaces
- **Decentralized Identity**: Potential integration with TON DNS for human-readable addresses
- **Smart Contract Interoperability**: Asynchronous call support for cross-platform dApps

Use cases under exploration may include:

- Unified authentication using TON DNS aliases
- One-click deployment of Eliza plugins to TON Storage
- Shared liquidity pools between Eliza DeFi modules and TON-based DEXs
