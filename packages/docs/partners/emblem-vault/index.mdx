NFT infrastructure.

## About Emblem Vault

Emblem Vault is a Web3 infrastructure solution specializing in crosschain digital asset management. It enables users to store, trade, and transfer fungible/non-fungible assets across incompatible blockchains (UTXO-based like Bitcoin and account-based like Ethereum) without traditional bridging. Its core innovation uses ERC-721/ERC-1155 tokenized vaults that act as programmable multi-asset wallets, each containing private keys to assets on supported chains.

Key offerings include:

- Crosschain NFT trading (e.g., Bitcoin Ordinals on Ethereum marketplaces)
- Historical NFT preservation for early blockchain projects (Rare Pepes, Spells of Genesis)
- Vault minting/management tools for developers via SDK

## Technology

Emblem Vault’s stack combines smart contracts (Solidity) with decentralized key management:

- **Multi-chain support**: Integrates 20+ chains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, and non-EVM networks
- **Burn-to-unlock mechanism**: Destroying the vault NFT releases associated private keys, granting asset ownership
- **SDK**: Allows developers to embed vault creation, asset management, and crosschain interactions into apps

This solves liquidity fragmentation by letting NFTs exist natively on their origin chain while being tradable on secondary markets (e.g., OpenSea).

## Key Features

1. **Crosschain interoperability** between UTXO and account-model blockchains
2. **Multi-asset vaults** holding cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and tokens simultaneously
3. **Historical NFT support** for Bitcoin Counterparty, Dogeparty, and Namecoin assets
4. **Batch minting/ERC-1155 compatibility** for scalable collections
5. **Mobile-optimized vault management** via Emblem Vision platform
6. **Decentralized governance** for protocol upgrades
7. **Gas-efficient claims** via Merkle tree proofs for large distributions

## Integration with Eliza

Emblem Vault integrates with ElizaOS through:

- **SDK-powered workflows**: Developers use Emblem’s JavaScript SDK to add vaulting features directly to ElizaOS apps
- **Unified asset dashboard**: Users view/manage crosschain holdings within Eliza’s interface
- **Smart contract hooks**: Automated triggers for vault creation based on Eliza agent interactions

A dedicated [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-obsidian) enables note-taking systems to reference vault metadata, while Hedera integrations allow HBAR token distributions through vaults.

## Recent Developments

- **2024 SDK launch**: Introduced developer tools for custom vault implementations (Jan 2024)
- **Solana/Tezos expansions**: Added support for compressed NFTs and FA2 standards (Q1 2024)
- **Crosschain Ventures partnership**: Acquired to accelerate enterprise adoption (June 2024)
- **ERC-1155 upgrades**: Enabled fractional vault ownership and group claims

Upcoming features include AI-driven vault analytics and zero-knowledge proof privacy layers.

## Market Position

- **Historical NFT leader**: 40,000+ ETH vault trading volume across 6,900 holders
- **Competitors**: Outperforms bridging protocols like Polygon Supernets in UTXO compatibility
- **Key partners**: OpenSea (marketplace integration), Crosschain Ventures (enterprise adoption), Hedera (consensus services)
