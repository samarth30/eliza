Web3 infrastructure.

## About WAYE

Waye is a specialized Web3 infrastructure provider focused on building decentralized networks and tools that power next-generation applications. Their core offerings include distributed storage solutions, blockchain interoperability protocols, and developer tools for creating trustless systems. Waye positions itself as an enabling layer for decentralized applications (dApps), particularly those requiring high-throughput data handling and cross-chain compatibility.

In the Web3 ecosystem, Waye addresses critical infrastructure gaps by providing:

- **Decentralized storage networks** analogous to IPFS/Filecoin but optimized for AI/ML workloads
- **Modular blockchain frameworks** that allow developers to customize consensus mechanisms
- **Web3 middleware** for seamless integration of off-chain data into smart contracts

Their infrastructure is particularly significant for AI-driven dApps, as it provides scalable data pipelines and verifiable computation environments—key requirements for autonomous agent ecosystems like ElizaOS.
