ArenaX Labs is a Toronto-based innovator at the intersection of AI, gaming, and blockchain. Founded in 2018 and rebranded in 2021, the company focuses on creating AI-driven gaming experiences that educate users about machine learning while delivering competitive gameplay. Its flagship product, **AI Arena**, is a PvP platform fighter where players train AI-powered NFT characters to battle autonomously using imitation-learning techniques. The company has raised $11.25M total funding, including a $6M round led by Framework Ventures in early 2024.

**Core offerings**:

- **ARC**: A white-label AI gaming SDK enabling third-party studios to build games with human-AI collaboration mechanics.
- **SAI**: A gamified research platform hosting machine learning competitions to solve complex AI problems.
- **AI Arena**: Ethereum-native fighting game combining AI training, NFTs, and blockchain-based rewards ($NRN token).

As a Web3 pioneer, ArenaX Labs uses blockchain for scalable value distribution in esports ecosystems and NFT-based ownership of AI characters.
