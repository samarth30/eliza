Decentralized cloud computing infrastructure.

## About Aethir

Aethir is a decentralized cloud computing infrastructure provider focused on delivering scalable, enterprise-grade GPU resources for AI, machine learning, and gaming applications. By leveraging a distributed network of GPU providers, Aethir offers high-performance computing power without the limitations of centralized data centers. Its decentralized model democratizes access to advanced computational resources, particularly in underserved regions.

**Main Products/Services**:

- **Aethir Earth**: Bare-metal GPU cloud for AI training and inference.
- **Aethir Atmosphere**: Cloud gaming rendering service for low-latency experiences.
- **Aethir Edge**: Enterprise-grade edge AI devices integrating distributed GPU resources.

**Significance in Web3**:  
Aethir pioneers decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) for GPU cloud computing, addressing critical gaps in cost, scalability, and accessibility for compute-intensive industries. Its tokenized governance model ($ATH) and community-driven resource pooling position it as a leader in Web3 infrastructure.

## Technology

**Stack & Innovations**:

- **Decentralized GPU Network**: Aggregates idle GPU resources globally via node operators (Containers, Indexers, Checkers).
- **Edge Computing**: Combines Qualcomm-powered Aethir Edge devices with cloud infrastructure for low-latency processing.
- **Checker Nodes**: 91,000+ nodes validate service quality, ensuring reliability and performance.

**Technical Approach**:  
Aethir's architecture pools underutilized GPUs into a unified network, dynamically allocating resources for AI training, inference, and cloud gaming. The platform uses smart contracts to automate payments and governance via the $ATH token.

**Problems Solved**:

- Eliminates centralized cloud chokeholds.
- Reduces costs by 30-50% compared to traditional providers like AWS.
- Enables access to high-end GPUs in regions with limited infrastructure.
