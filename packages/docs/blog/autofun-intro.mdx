# auto.fun: Where AI Projects Thrive, Not Just Launch

## The problem with token launches and how we fixed it

The era of pure speculation and disposable memecoins is giving way to a new generation of projects that blend AI, tokenomics, and long-term vision.

When we launched our own project's token, we did it the "right" way – a fair launch, open to the public, allowing anyone to participate from day one. And by all metrics, it was a success: massive interest, high engagement, and meta-changing adoption of the elizaOS framework.

But there was a problem.

Fair launches, while philosophically aligned with crypto's ethos, often leave project teams struggling. We had no reserved supply to fund development. Selling tokens to cover expenses wasn't an option – it creates FUD in the community, and for good reason: when a team is forced to dump its own token to survive, it could signal instability. The

[reality is](https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1886829695343161494) that when your project is only 2 months old and with no VC backing, you don't have the basics covered, let alone revenue to fund progress.

At the same time, we knew all too well about the opposite extreme: closed-door, insider-led token launches that benefited only a select few. Low float, high FDV launches that price out regular users. Bundled deals where insiders control supply and the community is left as exit liquidity.

Neither of these models work in the long term. So we built

[auto.fun](https://auto.fun/)

– an AI-native, creator-first launchpad that finds the balance between truly fair access and long-term sustainability.

## The next evolution of crypto launches: AI-native, creator-first

We designed [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) to support the entire lifecycle of projects – from inception to launch, and beyond:

- Fairer than fair launch: A bonding curve mechanism that lets teams secure up to 50% of their token supply before market listing, avoiding the pitfalls of a pure fair launch while ensuring community access isn't gated by insiders.
- No-code agent builder: [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) allows creators to launch agents alongside their token with the Fleek integration, or to connect an existing agent to their token in a couple of clicks.
- AI-generated marketing: Create tokens, content, and assets from a single prompt.
- Sustainable project funding – The liquidity NFT mechanism ensures that projects earn ongoing revenue from trading fees, reducing reliance on token sales to fund development.

## Why [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) is the best place to launch your project

Launching a project isn't just about putting a token on the market – it's about building a community and sustaining it.

We know the power of strong messaging and community engagement. Our own project took off in part because of its memetic origins, capturing attention in a crowded market. But visibility alone isn't enough.

[auto.fun](https://auto.fun/)

ensures that projects launching on our platform have the tools to not just attract an audience, but to retain and grow it sustainably.

This is why the best projects are launching on [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/).

We're working with cutting-edge teams building AI-powered agents, innovative agent-native tokens, and projects that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in crypto. Some are launching entirely new tokens and agents, while others are bringing existing AI tools to integrate with our launchpad.

Here's what's coming:

- [@MakeFight_Great](https://x.com/@MakeFight_Great)
  – AI-powered social agents BrawlChain and The Algorithm will battle it out on X, each with its own token.
- [@AlloraNetwork](https://x.com/@AlloraNetwork)
  – Launching [@Squidllora](https://x.com/@Squidllora), leveraging the Allora Network's predictive inferences and advanced trading signals to manage a portfolio.
- [@drpepeai](https://x.com/@drpepeai)
  – Launching [@DogLifeAI](https://x.com/@DogLifeAI), a medical AI agent providing detailed advice and services for dog owners, with a token that grants access to this and future agents in their ecosystem.
- [@kingczai](https://x.com/@kingczai)
  – With their token they're set to unlock exclusive perks and community access—no secret handshake needed.
- [@comput3ai](https://x.com/@comput3ai)
  – Launching [$COM](https://x.com/search?q=%24COM&src=cashtag_click), that will act as credits for their decentralized compute services.

These are just a few of the projects joining us at launch, each leveraging the AI-native tooling and sustainable tokenomics that make [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) the best place to launch.

## [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) is YOURS

Every token that graduates through [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) feeds the flywheel for $ai16z holders: our portion of swap fees of graduated Agent Tokens (ATs) is routed into open‑market buybacks of $ai16z. And once the upcoming $ai16z : AT secondary pools go live, they'll be paired with the very ATs that generated the revenue, deepening liquidity on both sides and capturing a perpetual share of trading fees. The result is a compounding loop where every launch, swap, and routing path strengthens $ai16z's liquidity and steadily channels platform value back to long‑term holders.

## A truly AI-empowered future

[auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) isn't just about launching tokens – it's about creating the most advanced AI-enhanced platform for new projects. As elizaOS evolves, so will [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/). Here's what the short-term roadmap looks like:

- v2 of the Eliza framework will bring more sophisticated agent creation tools, allowing users to build agents with real utility.
- AI-powered tools will enable creators to generate more images, videos, and marketing content for their social agent to promote.
- Expanded integrations will allow for even more complex AI-powered interactions and tokenomics customization.

With [auto.fun](https://auto.fun/), you don't just launch a token—you launch an AI-native ecosystem, designed for long-term sustainability and growth.

## Join the next wave of AI-native crypto

[auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) is built for the next chapter of crypto. The era of launching purely memetic tokens with no utility is fading. The next generation of projects need to be AI-forward and built to last.

[auto.fun](https://auto.fun/) is at the forefront of this movement. If you're building any kind of project – whether it's an agent, a service, meme, or a new form of digital interaction – there's no better place to launch.

We're not just another launchpad. We're the AI-native creator-first platform that finally gets it right.

Welcome to the future of AI-powered token launches.
