okay so I've just tested this and it's working:

and then as I am spinning pg in sep container,
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5555/eliza2 eliza,
or you can add this in .env and then:
add this to .env -> POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5555/eliza2,
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env eliza,

I was looking at the discord plugin
Actually in the entire monorepo I can only see where the events are being emitted
Image
are they being subscribed to at all?
I haven't run it with the discord plugin active yet but just reading it idk how it works after the event DiscordEventTypes.MESSAGE_SENT is emitted for example
Like in plugin-bootstrap event MESSAGE_RECIEVED is picked up
Image
but for plugin-discord its not picked up at all anywhere in the repo
Same for Telegram events on the telegram plugin
Image
standard ‚Äî 20/04/2025, 22:08

Oh I see
Image
It literally emits both
But when would the Discord specific one get picked up?
Also - if we assume that plugin-bootstrap picks up event MESSAGE_RECEIVED
Callback gets called once before processActions with the response content
Image
When I've been testing it though it calls action REPLY which then hits the callback again, so that's the same callback twice

that part is confusing me

Hi guys. How can I write to the developers about my request so that they notice it? Why hasn't such a function been implemented yet - like posting pictures that are already ready and just lie in a folder (for example, on the server). It is necessary for the AI ‚Äã‚Äãagent, when creating a post or writing a Reply, to also attach a picture that it will take from the folder at random, absolutely any. Please help convey this idea to the developers. Or if someone already knows how to implement this, please share the solution.
standard ‚Äî 21/04/2025, 04:05
I was confused about how the callback is called before process actions but also in the reply action
So effectively its called twice
I see through comments that the first callback assumes the text isn't present in the response but via log debugging i see that it is
So ur callback in whatever discord service or anything would get hit twice

[ai16z] <k_carv> Not sure I‚Äôve understood correctly but you need to add your API key to the env file.

If it‚Äôs a separate source of instance to generic OpenAI you might need to set this up as a new LLM option in the framework

‚Äî 21/04/2025, 23:57
[ai16z] <bowtiedbluefin> Exactly what I was asking - if there was a custom OpenAI compatible LLM option where you add the base url and api key. I guess I need to create a new plugin

[ai16z] <k_carv> Gotcha, yeah I‚Äôve not seen that before. Unsure if that‚Äôd be a new plugin, or adding a new instance provider within the env file.

It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve done before. One of the core devs might be able to add further colour.

it's the default character.ts file. I deleted / modified the lore, adjevtives, bio etc. Even the hard coded messageExamples don't seem to work for me. And obviously also the temperature doesn't change it.

drop pg instance -> drop volume if you don't need to persist data.

start again.

this is happening bc you have \_\_drizzle_migrations table in your postgres.

also you could remove this record from table for the migraitons to run again...

for bio, lore, message examples if you could clarify the issue a bit more?
Zarathustra ‚Äî 22/04/2025, 00:47
I did change it in the code. It's confirmed in terminal when I run it. But I have the feeling it hase no influence on the character.

Running into the same CSP issues with V2 on a Windows machine - used gitbash to work out the installation.

Server is running from pnpm start:client but the browser can't connect. character.json is being found and loaded into the server instance.

One issue looks to be Content Security Policy triggering from an eval statement.

Did you find a workaround?

Gemini caching is now live!,
75% off prompt token prices, and we made the API extremely simple:

Just set cache_control on a message. Exactly the same as Anthropic. Docs are here: https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/prompt-caching#google-gemini

We made it significantly easier to use than Gemini direct:
You do not need to manually create, update, or delete caches.,
You do not need to manage cache names or TTL explicitly.,
Plus, it's standardized with other models like Anthropic,

Current model support and other details here: https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/1914699401127157933 @everyone

Eddy is part of the org.

How to start the org ->
git checkout v2-develop,
bun i,
bun run build,
setup your .env -> you'll see in the example Eddy operates on discord/telegram,
make sure you set this in .env as well: DEVREL_IMPORT_KNOWLEDGE=true,
you can also tweek the code so it loads the .ts files -> here https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/v2-develop/packages/the-org/src/devRel/index.ts#L94,
once you setup the .env,
bun run start,

usually I comment some agents here so I don't have full swarm as it's easier to develop https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/v2-develop/packages/the-org/src/index.ts#L133

if you don't provide it to the REST-API it's gonna be randomized keep that in mind.

hello eliza team
i have built an agent where user can perform trading actions through a platform
for that user needs to set up his wallet in the agent right?
i set the wallet private key in .env file, but in this way, the agent can only manage one wallet
this means the agent is for only one user, is there any way to bypass this?
is there any way to make the agent like normal frontend which has wallet connect functionality so that users can connect their own wallet, and make actions with their wallet instead of pre-set wallet

NEW: Universal PDF Support üìÑ‚ö°Ô∏è,
OpenRouter now supports PDF processing for every model ‚Äì and I think it's the first platform to do this!

üéØ Key highlights:,
Universal compatibility: Works with any LLM available on OpenRouter.,
All PDF types: Handles any PDF, including image-only scans.,
Native support: Automatically uses native PDF support for providers that support it, including Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenAI.,
Multimodal magic: For multimodal models, we automatically send embedded images from PDFs directly to the model.,
Combine with other integrations: Pair it with our web search feature to blend PDF data with real-time info, or with the Auto Router,
Flexible integration: Accessible via API and directly from the OpenRouter Chatroom - process multiple PDFs simultaneously with multiple models in a single request.,

‚öôÔ∏è Pricing:,
Two PDF processing engines to choose from:

mistral-ocr (default): OCR support with text and embedded images extraction ‚Äî $2 per 1000 pages.,
pdf-text: Text-only extraction without OCR or image support ‚Äî free.,

üìñ Documentation & Getting Started:,
Check out the full docs and implementation guide:
‚Üí openrouter.ai/docs/features/images-and-pdfs

Video demo here, and more info in the announcement: https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/1915083006349382033. @everyone

this means the agent is for only one user, is there any way to bypass this?
is there any way to make the agent like normal frontend which has wallet connect functionality so that users can connect their own wallet, and make actions with their wallet instead of pre-set wallet

i dont understand why you have to pass in providers

i think i'm using v2-dev, though now i'm setting up the project via elizaos cli instead of directly cloning via git. (does say on cli current:10.0.-beta.37) ,  wanting to modify open-weather plugin after install , but if I go to project plugin directory or clone plugin via elizos-plugins repo , to build either by running "bun run build" , I get the same DTS error.

Plugins are yet to be migrated/compatible with V2. Team is working on this as we speak. Will share an update once it's available.
Acul ‚Äî 24/04/2025, 21:20
I noticed in the open-weather plugin in the action handler function  it uses a runtime function called updateRecentMessageState() which I couldn't find in v2-dev implementation , or previous ( meaning it hasn't been working for while?) , anyways,,  was attempting to have a look see if I could get it working - might wait for migration ,, cheers

Okay sooooooooo the default starterPlugin was the issue. Again this was from a fresh 'create'. i simply removed that from index.ts and it worked.
export const projectAgent: ProjectAgent = {
  character,
  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => await initCharacter({ runtime }),
  plugins: [], <------ remove starterPlugin
};

Update on Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental Free,
Demand for Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental continues to exceed available capacity significantly. To address this, we are removing Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental from the free model tier and imposing stricter usage limits: 1 request per minute and a total of 1000 requests per day (including errors). The model will continue to be free to use.

This adjustment means that your daily quota of 1000 requests for free models will remain unaffected by requests made to Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Our goal with these changes is to clarify usage expectations around this model and the free tier.

For those seeking higher reliability and fewer constraints, we recommend utilizing the paid variant of Gemini 2.5 Pro. Your credits (such as the $10 minimum purchase) can now directly support usage on this paid endpoint, while preserving your full free-tier quotas.

More details in the thread below üßµ

Update on Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental Free,
Demand for Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental continues to exceed available capacity significantly. To address this, we are removing Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental from the free model tier and imposing stricter usage limits: 1 request per minute and a total of 1000 requests per day (including errors). The model will continue to be free to use.

This adjustment means that your daily quota of 1000 requests for free models will remain unaffected by requests made to Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Our goal with these changes is to clarify usage expectations around this model and the free tier.

For those seeking higher reliability and fewer constraints, we recommend utilizing the paid variant of Gemini 2.5 Pro. Your credits (such as the $10 minimum purchase) can now directly support usage on this paid endpoint, while preserving your full free-tier quotas.

More details in the thread below üßµ

ight, will drop it off here, off an 'npx elizaos create' and 'npx elizaos start':

telegram and local client work fine,

discord doesn't work, bot doesn't show up as online (maybe its the dev bot settings? but i matched 'em up with Red so they should be working cuz she is),

twitter seeeems like it doesn't work either (at least asking eli to post doesn't, we'll see if the min/max env vars kick it on later,

cc @shaw tryna hit ur bounties, u can hit up @eli_von_fun_bot on tg if u get bored to test his cringe levels

logs of me trying all of the above are attached.

[ai16z] <orayo> Im curious how did you get telegram and local client working.

I was using v1 late december by forking the repo with plugins for discord and twitter and it was super useful, but somehow everything broke when i migrated to v2 when i used eliza create

Embedding isn't working because the plugins cannot be downloaded, including openai and anthropic so the entire module cannot function.

Should i have just forked eliza-starter?
yikesawjeez ‚Äî 27/04/2025, 09:10
mm they worked out of the box for me but i also have a ver of v2 i cloned down and linked to my npx command back when it was beta, so it might be that i'm still on that. but i'd start from scratch rather than migrating personally
i did have to put in my github PAT, once i got that in then the plugins were able to download. if you just run npx eliazos create, cd in, npx elizaos start, eliza should start up, if she does then you shouuuuld be good to go wrt embeddings
current thing that has working local and working tg is above process ^
i generally recommend once you get an eliza configured the way you like her, just fork that version off and don't update it until you've tried cloning down main and eveyrthing works the way you want it
it still moves giga fast so if you try to keep it updated it'll inevitably break something lol
but atm the pure npx commands work for me, so wroth a try if you havent in a while
i wouldn't use any of the starter repos atm  (i think), they're all mostly older versions and might have compatibility issues etc. new version of starter is basically npx elizaos create
i have an eliza folder in my Projects folder that has like 8 versions of eliza in it by now at various points when i could succesfully decringify her üòÇ

did you put your github PAT in your .env ?

yikesawjeez ‚Äî 27/04/2025, 09:24
it asked for it when i did the create
fyi don't do it with your work github/make a separate gh acct for it, atm i think it requests write/read to all repos (could be fixed by now tho)
presumably ole shaw won't steal all your private data bc you'd yell at him on twitter and stop using his agent framework, so incentive-wise it's not a concern, but a security-best-practices aka your compliance team's expectations would be to isolate full-perms request tokens away from anything meaningful
ik scoping down perm requests is on the roadmap so eventually it'll be sorted but when it was beta there was a buncha weird lil plugin edge cases so had to whole-hog it iirc

@OpsDev | ONYX

if you take the agent id
and hit below endpoint
http://localhost:3000/api/agents/b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d

you will be able to call agent through api and integrate it with your frontend.

I think you have to host your eliza cli version to a seperate backend endpoint if on production.

note : this is my agent id so this api endpoint might not work for you.

which command are you using
Ahsen Tahir ‚Äî 30/04/2025, 12:04
pnpm one that is given in the readme on github
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter.git
cd eliza-starter
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start
sam-developer ‚Äî 30/04/2025, 12:04
that is old
can you use the cli
can you try these
Also you might be needing bun for it

npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta
elizaos create or npx elizaos create (since you are on windows)
select pglite upon start
bun start when inside the created project

can you check you API key, give all permissions and don't  dorestricted on the openai console?
hh ‚Äî 30/04/2025, 18:00
yeah I'm sure that only doest with eliza os
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 30/04/2025, 18:08
if you think API key is okay then:
did you customized character?,
and if so what is the order of plugins in your character?,

in case you didn't changed anything and just trying to start by populating .env then I think smth is wrong with the API key and your setup on openai console.

all I have in .env and elizaos start works for me.

I have all permissions enabled on my openai key.

Hey I'm getting this error

Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING

I have an anthropic key and openai key and still no luck. Any ideas?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 30/04/2025, 18:19
the Anthropic plugin does not have a TEXT_EMBEDDING model so you'll need some plugin like OpenAI.

The screenshot shows the order of plugins in your character file. This order matters because if a capability is missing in one plugin, it will fallback to the next LLM plugin in the list.

So for example, this configuration will add all the possible models from Anthropic, and then OpenAI will add the TEXT_EMBEDDING functionality that Anthropic lacks.

üê≥ New mysterious model! DeepSeek Prover v2,
This morning, the DeepSeek team silently dropped a new 671B model on Hugging Face. Not much is known about the model yet, as it was published without a description or announcement

The previous release (v1.5) pushed the frontier forward on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, using Reinforcement Learning & a Monte-Carlo search that employs an intrinsic-reward-driven exploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths.

Let‚Äôs see what v2 can do. Try it out in your own evals and let us know what you think!

Available in both free and paid variants:

Just install elizaos cli beta, config .env, add following knowledge to src/index.ts

knowledge: [
"Rokie is a superman. He loves peace He fly around the world everyday He dont eat"
],

Then run: elizaos start

The agent name is Eliza as default. Rokie is a name that mentioned in the knowledge story
sam-developer ‚Äî 01/05/2025, 15:23
npm uninstall -g @elizaos/cli
rm -rf ~/.eliza

npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta
npx elizaos create
cd project that got created
input the env keys value
elizaos start

if things give some embedding issue it means your system doesn't have any local model restart it again and it will start downloading local ai model
otherwise put open ai or anthropic key in env for outputs.

make sure for if you want local ai model to run you should have good amount of free ram as ai models are usually heavy and space taking on


can you try this once

Hi, do we have a way to count, retrieve the total amount of token that've been used from a a message.

Like, I send a message, then I can retrieve the total amount of token it was used to generate the final answer ? (embedding + every useModels..)

it really can't be easier then this.

your knowledge.

my character looks like this and you don't need true/false, just the content in the knowledge section.

notice also my question it has a lot more context which significantly improves chances to find some similar "knowledge" in database.
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03/05/2025, 02:40
To give you an explanation on this - yes we use similarity score which is calculated over cosine distance.

And then also bm25 for reranking which will improve the similarity score. Means better context for the agent.
Thanh ‚Äî 03/05/2025, 03:21
Thankyou @Tangl @0xbbjoker @sayonara : Actually I would not be the person who contribute the knowledge. Our clients will do. So I am quite worry that if they input : Rokie is a superman. He loves peace He fly around the world everyday He dont eat ; then expect the correct answer for these questions: Who is Rokie, Gender? which is totally answered correctly by any Ai Chat with fastest models from ChatGPT, Gemini, Deepseek

0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03/05/2025, 03:30

I don't see any definition of gender in your "articles" for Rokie. So any LLM will make assumption unless there is strict context in the RAG which would explain the gender. Not sure did I miss something from your context?

I don't wanna say our RAG is way better then openai. But I don't see any diff.

I know anthropic has some secret sauce on it and I'll try to introduce this on ElizaOS in the coming weeks.

if i add a bunch of PDFs to my agents /knowledge directory how do i know the agent has processed them? I also see in the docs that PDFs have a specific PDF runtime service. Do i only use the this for loading pdfs dynamically or is this not necessary as long as the directory structure matches the docs?

  // Add knowledge directories configuration
  knowledge: [
    {
      directory: 'knowledge/shared/pdf-templates-main',
      shared: true,
    },
    // Case examples specific to Agent
    {
      directory: 'knowledge/Agent/pdf-examples',
      shared: true,
    }
  ],
I tried asking the agent about the pdfs and it said it didnt know.
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03/05/2025, 04:06
not sure if you could elaborate this a bit more? what are you trying to accomplish?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03/05/2025, 04:12
Hmmm, okay so this is the 0.25.9 version of ElizaOS, and if you feed in knowledge like this:

Your PDFs will be chunked into smaller pieces called fragments.,
You can't ask the agent "Hey, do you have those PDFs?",
The agent is not aware of those PDFs.,
You trigger the search on the database with your message to the agent (that's called context).,
That context is transformed into a vector.,
Then we compare that vector with the fragments in the database and look for similarity between your vector and what's in the database.,
The search operation binds the knowledge to the prompt.,
And this is the point where the "context" is extended with your knowledge (that you fed into the database).,

Though I haven't tried PDF import for a while now on the 0.25.9 version.
YungYoda ‚Äî 03/05/2025, 04:19
Ah okay so if i want the agent to bring up specific documents is it better to dynamically pull in the pfs through the provider/action pattern instead?

While it seems to be vectoring the information, I can't get the bot to return the correct information from my knowledge base, instead it pulls the prior knowledge that OpenAI has. I've followed the docs (https://docs.eliza.how/docs/core/knowledge) but can't get it to work. I feel like i might be missing something but not sure what.

I've already tried to:

rm -rf ~/.eliza


But it did not work

Any idea?

I have WSL installed, node is up to date, npm as well
Note: I did not create a "project" I first wanted to use the vanilla installation of Eliza as per the documention

EDIT:,
This seems to be the error:

SOLUTION :yes:,
I finally made it work,
so basically I installed Ubuntu via Microsoft Store and then ran my commands in the Ubuntu CLI, it got me rid of the Database Adapter error,


Still wasn't enough to work, I then got the No TEXT_EMBEDDING error, I then:

started using "elizaos start" and on the web interface I added the openai plugin (which you can do in CLI as well),
created a .env file specifying my OPENAI_API_KEY=,

and it worked, I am currently chatting with ElizaOS using my OpenAI API Key

This was only step 1 tho, need to dig this more and more now.
Hope this helps

So I have a plugin created by elizaos create --type plugin and when I run yarn dev everything works (this is plugin that generate random text every 3-4h). And how can I integrate it with eliza project created by run elizaos create --type project? How can I run my plugin in elizaos project with some particular character? Should I publish my plugin first? And how can I create character and some way pass it to plugin?
morlok ‚Äî 05/05/2025, 23:07
regarding the plugin thing, depends on how you want to do stuff, but you do not need to create a separate plugin like that (maybe you do in case of a team working on it, clean code or whatever...), but within the project, you can simply create the plugin there and import it within the agent.

regarding, the character implementation, within the you can create your own character and within the plugin list import your plugin

Hey, anyone know how I can make sure that nothing gets added to the memory by default when an action is triggered? eliza.how tells me that I can set "suppressMemoryUpdate" to true in the handler, but I dont think thats correct
sayonara ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 15:11
what commands did you run before! can you share your elizaos version

elizaos --version
sayonara ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 15:12
can you update your cli with npm i -g @elizaos/cli@beta
a4oya4o ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 15:53
how do i make a character to use the packages/core/... config files that i have set
and do i need to add actions in order for the agent to process for example a semantic serach etc.
sam-developer ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 16:01
I think you can simple create a character using cli on gui
when you run elizaos locally
sam-developer ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 16:02
if you place things in knowledge folder , it will automatically do semantic search for it
‚Å†‚ùìÔΩútech-support‚Å† check this out for cli installation
a4oya4o ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 16:04
i want to run it in prod, so basically what i am trying to do is to call and process my .env file in env.ts which is in packages/core. however if i start my character with pnpm, the character doesnt use my packages/core settings, so i am wondering how do i make the character use the settings and how the character can for example quote info on twitter.
I guess i will need an action for the information quoting on twitter, which i also dont know how to call trough my character
sam-developer ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 16:06
using cli would be best option
you can deploy things on prod as well
cli supports twitter as well
a4oya4o ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 16:07
im using 0.25.9 as the guides there are more comperhensive and detailed
not the 1 beta

a4oya4o ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 18:08
install bun with the npm install -g bun command and then try to manually install the plugin\
basically just install bun and it will automatically try to isntall the plugin with bun

If we want all messages stored to postgresSQL how to get around duplicate key constraint?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 20:17
could you elaborate pls?
Scooter ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 20:18
Seems the sql plugin sets up the databse to store memory of unique messages rather than all messages from a given user/identity
So mesages with the same content get converted to keys that are duplicates
and because of the unique constraint set by the plugin logic the duplicate is rejected
But I basically want to store full comment logs
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 20:21
Can you give me the exact constraint error that you see?

you storing to log table if I understood correctly?

so I suppose it's because of entity or room constraint not duplicated content?
Scooter ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 20:26
message: "(error) duplicate key value violates unique constraint "memories_pkey""

üöÄ  The new Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview snapshot is live now

You can continue using the same model slug as before, but we also updated it to remove the date from the name and updated the endpoints to specificaly point to the new date on Vertex and AI Studio. Check out the tweet from Google: https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1919770687167684808

And try the model out now! https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
Logan Kilpatrick (@OfficialLoganK) on X
Gemini 2.5 Pro just got an upgrade & is now even better at coding, with significant gains in front-end web dev, editing, and transformation.

We also fixed a bunch of function calling issues that folks have been reporting, it should now be much more reliable. More details in üßµ

I suppose your issue is because you are creating same id for memory twice. But can't be sure without more logs. I wanna see what does it call and from where.
Scooter ‚Äî 06/05/2025, 21:48
I think so too.  I have created some custom workflows and they are both attempting to send the same message id to the database pretty sure.
Isnt breaking anything but the terminal logs are pretty annoying lol

try to setup the workflow so it handles the ID properly. Make sure it always create diff ID or just leave it without ID

having a closer look at the debug output, what I'm observing is that after Eliza builds the object from messageHandlerTemplate, it returns on "actions": ["FETCH_VAULT_LIST", "REPLY"], and a "message". Then it executes my FETCH_VAULT_LIST, and after that it also executes the REPLY action with the "message", so the user gets both. I made a quick test with a simple HELLO_WORLD action from the sample plugin, and it doesn't return the REPLY action, any thoughts? thanks!

Getting service instrumentation not found in runtime errors.  Not breaking anything but is this from not registering my custom services with Eliza properly?

not sure how did you setup and why it doesn't post.

I have this simple example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4sp4ZncMWc&t=8s

if that helps
Dark Cobra ‚Äî 07/05/2025, 05:56
i just created the agent through the dashboard
i set up new ubuntu distro installed nvm and required node and then i got unzip and bun and then i did install eliza and then eliza start
ill try again with the video thanks for the resource
Scooter ‚Äî 07/05/2025, 08:40
Did you ever get this "Service instrumentation not found in runtime" error figured out? Having the same issue. Thinking I'm not registering my service extension in the way eliza expects.

Hi Devs,

i just cloned the eliza and installed few plugins using npx eliza pluigns add ....
including client-twitter.

all plugins (discord, farcaster, and others) are running ok so far, but twitter, i got this error:

Failed to import plugin: @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter Error: Cannot find package '@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter'


i checked the agent/node_modules, and all plugins and clients are there, except for twitter.

some clue on that?

already hit pnpm clean, rm node_modules and install build all over again and could not make it find client-twitter package...

0xCardiE ‚Äî 07/05/2025, 19:45
wondering what would be a way to use elizaOS for spining many different agents, like per user agent. meaning a user logs in to a site and he gets access to agent, another users does the same and he gets different elizaOS sessions.    Is the platform suitable for this kind of modification?

has anyone had success importing a plugin into eliza, and being able to see it in the plugins tab in the UI on a local build. I was asked to move the plugin to the new plugin registry (rather than the core eliza repo) and import it in the package.json file in eliza....and that works properly, but the UI will not pick it up

 ‚Äî 09/05/2025, 07:33
@Odilitime Claude gave me this response for my issue. You requested that I move out of the registry and into my own, and I'm seeing this problem. Can you help confirm:

ElizaOS Plugin Resolution Issue: GitHub Repository Organization Constraints
After a detailed analysis of the ElizaOS codebase, I've identified a specific issue with how ElizaOS resolves and loads plugins that aren't in the official elizaos-plugins organization.
The Problem
ElizaOS has hardcoded assumptions about plugin repository locations. When it fails to find a plugin in the npm registry, it attempts to resolve it via GitHub, but makes critical assumptions about the repository structure:
In the file eliza/packages/cli/src/utils/registry/index.ts, plugins are resolved through the getPluginRepository function:
Apply to index.ts
}
The DEFAULT_REGISTRY only contains official ElizaOS plugins:
Apply to index.ts
;
When a plugin is needed, ElizaOS tries to install it using npm first:
Apply to index.ts
404
After npm fails, it should try GitHub, but due to the way it builds repository URLs it's likely looking for:
Apply to index.ts
morpheus
instead of
Apply to index.ts
morpheus
The Root Issue
The core problem is that ElizaOS doesn't correctly parse and use the GitHub URL format from package.json. When you specify:
Apply to index.ts
"
ElizaOS is ignoring the "github:bowtiedbluefin/plugin-morpheus" part and trying to resolve "@elizaos/plugin-morpheus" through its standard resolution process, which assumes plugins are in the official registry.
Contradictory Requirements
There appears to be a contradiction between:
The ElizaOS documentation showing examples using github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-example
The request to NOT put your code in the elizaos-plugins registry and host through your own GitHub account
ElizaOS's current implementation doesn't fully support the second option due to hardcoded assumptions about repository paths.
Potential Solutions
Fix for ElizaOS: They need to modify their plugin resolution logic in getPluginRepository and related functions to properly handle GitHub URLs from package.json, particularly for plugins outside the elizaos-plugins organization.

I've proven this by also trying with another plugin currently within your plugin registry that pulls from github outside of the registry. It also failed to load that plugin. Additionally, I was able to implement a fix to get the plugin to show in the UI, but  it required me to add to eliza/packages/client/src/hooks/use-plugins.ts in addition to the package.json of "the-org" and the top level.

I didn't want to add into that index.json until I was confident it was working properly via testing. Did I misinterpret and it's actually pulling from that index.json file? Would love that to be my error

Edit: This can't be the issue because I also used a plugin from within the registry and it still didn't pull properly
(Side note: Tough situation because in this mechanism you wouldn't be able to test prior to PR)

Sure, but what kind of demo do you mean? I mean, the best way to try the service is to join the 24/7 Twitch livestream at https://www.twitch.tv/airewardrop and test the actions directly.

We're not fully ready for interaction via X and YouTube due to API limitations. We're working on a cost-effective solution using Scrap + WebSocket callbacks, but it's not reliable enough at the moment.

guys in order to make an agent to perform a transaction on solana mainnet, do i have to create an action, and where do i announce this action - in the character.json file or in the index.ts?
Pr‚≠ïf. J[UA]
 ‚Äî 09/05/2025, 19:22
I was able to get my Solana agent to do transactions on Mainnet by asking it in the online dashboard that I ran locally. I asked cursor to add the plugin and it added code to the character file. Not sure if anywhere else. And of coarse details for wallet and chain in the env file and should work.
Sorry I only use Ai for setup and don‚Äôt know the technical way to explain.
a4oya4o ‚Äî 09/05/2025, 19:30
okay how do you call your env file in the character without exposing private keys api keys etc
You only use the localhost GUI to set it up?

hello everyone. i have customized everything in my project under src/index.ts and when i then start eliza via cli, i only have the eliza standard agent in the cli and web dashboard without my changes. what am i doing wrong?  many thanks

My bad.

Ok so i have a plugin that give me some data such as (that the data in the chat)

Top 3 Stablecoin Yields on Ethereum:

morpho-blue (Ethereum): 21.70% APY for SAKURAUSDC
Type: Lending Pool,
morpho-blue (Ethereum): 19.24% APY for APRUSR
Type: Lending Pool,
spectra-v2 (Ethereum): 14.56% APY for YVCURVE-GHO-USR
Type: Pool,

BUT

i get this message on the UI or telegram
[REALTIME_DATA] found 3 top stablecoin pools on Ethereum:
morpho-blue (ethereum): 16.84% apy for aprusr.
pendle (ethereum): 14.22% apy for fgho.
spectra-v2 (ethereum): 13.50% apy for yvcurve-gho-usr.

real-time data from defillama, not hardcoded values.

which was an oooold message. And i'm stuck here

Reminder for devs: OpenRouter will automatically "stick" you to providers that show that they're caching your requests.

üí°TIP: You don't need to implement sticky inference caching yourself.

OpenRouter "sticks" you to providers as they cache your requests (until the provider expires their cache), and passes the full cost savings to you.

are you on 1.0.0 or 0.25.x?
modelProvider is no longer used in newer versions it seems, you need to make sure you set all required values in your .env file and then just include the plugins in your characterfile for the llm's you want
If it falls back to llama then somewhere its configured to do so, just search throught the source for the model name used and you'll find it

TH3H4RM1N4T0R ‚Äî 11/05/2025, 22:15
Not sure whether it's included by default, but you can just add it, to the package.json, to the plugins in your character.ts/json file and then re-run (bun install bun run build bun run start or just elizaos start i guess), see if that makes a difference
you can also set LOG_LEVEL=debug in your .env and see what the logs do
You also need to make sure that your App in Discord has all the correct gateway intents enabled

TH3H4RM1N4T0R ‚Äî 11/05/2025, 23:01
You could also add this to the init of your plugin/project:

  // Register runtime events
  runtime.registerEvent('DISCORD_WORLD_JOINED', async (params: { server: Guild }) => {
    logger.debug('Discord connected')
  });

adding 5$ to openai should be enough i think! or you could pair with local ai plugin;

where you define plugin keep anthropic first and local ai after
bitcryptowski.btc ‚Äî 12/05/2025, 13:51
but how does the agent decide to use claude as the main model and do the text embeddings via openai? i don't quite check that in the new version yet.
sayonara ‚Äî 12/05/2025, 13:51
based on first found order; anthropic doesnt have embedding so it will find it from next plugin that has it
if you put openai first; it will use it all from openai

I can get my agent to respond to users with @username but under the hood it i snot passing the actual discord user id so the @mention isnt highlighted blue and user's don't get a notification.  Doesn't eliza do this out of the box if it has the discord plugin?

The issue was that your plugin.ts defined static return values in the models: section for TEXT_SMALL and TEXT_LARGE. This prevented ElizaOS from using real models like OpenAI or Claude ‚Äî the agent never generated proper responses and either replied with hardcoded text or failed entirely for complex prompts.
sayonara ‚Äî 12/05/2025, 18:28

you gonna need to edit the character - add plugins you wanna use.

right now default is using plugin-local-ai that's why it's installing node-llama-cpp.

you gonna need to add @elizaos/plugins-ollama to character file as well as this configuration you sent to the .env

How would I got about parsing a UUID eliza assigns a memory such that I get the original discord message ID?  How does eliza generate its UUIDs?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 13/05/2025, 17:51
you would need to store a mapping

discord message id to memory id
Scooter ‚Äî 13/05/2025, 18:14
Ended up changing my approach. I am now trying to format the responses to discord messages as replies.  I start by storing the actual discord message id to the metadata field stored to the memory.  Then later retrieve it by memory UUID and use it in the reply.   For some reason though this is failing.  Here are the logs.

The TWITTER_DRY_RUN setting is a configuration flag used in both interactions.ts and post.ts. When TWITTER_DRY_RUN is enabled (set to true), the system will log the actions it would normally take, like sending tweets or replies, but it won't actually perform these actions on Twitter.

Thanks man, also another thing, some of the rest api endpoints appear to be broken. For example when i call send message to agent endpoint, the program crashes with an undefined entityId error. I want to connect my agents to my website for chatting. But other issues also arise regarding worlds and rooms. Since the api docs are limited and a little vague, can you provide the user flow of third party website api Integrations?

When I change to ElizaOs v2-develop branch, how can I create a character file that will show up in the frontend? And why when do I create a new character in the frontend and add plugins from there, they do not show in the repository?
aith ‚Äî 14/05/2025, 02:06
Okay not sure what's going on here. I have the character definitions and the name changed but it still shows up as Eliza. And, it doesn't proceed further. Followed the instructions for v2 as they were here https://eliza.how/blog/twitter-agent-guide

as far as I know the chat/messages feature in our client is using websockets

I would suggest similar if not same logic.

0xbbjoker ‚Äî 14/05/2025, 02:29
end-point should be the same you just use wss

client: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/v2-develop/packages/client/src/lib/socketio-manager.ts

0xbbjoker ‚Äî 14/05/2025, 02:37
using the CLI:

Install the ElizaOS CLI tool:
npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta

Create a new ElizaOS application:
elizaos create my-app

Navigate to your project directory:
cd my-app

Edit your character in the index.ts file according to your needs lmk if you need some guidance here
Start the development server:

It might be that the model doesn't run on your architecture; I think I've had that as well at some point. If you just want to get running and don't need a local model, provide an OpenAI or Anthropic API key, then it won't try to use a local model.
Hey, I'm trying to set up a X/Twitter monitor that simply forwards all matching tweets to a discord channel. Is that something that should work out of the box?
I can get my agent to reply on X if I post something there, and on Discord if I post something there, but it seems like the cross-posting doesn't work. If I ask it in the ElizaOS chat interface it says it can't access latest tweets, and it can't post anything on discord either.
So, individually all channels work, but transferring info doesn't üòï

this using pglite and it's by default ig

tables are setup correctly the error is constraint on table

Hidden Forces ‚Äî 14/05/2025, 06:50
"this using pglite and it's by default ig"

I don't understand that statement.

"tables are setup correctly the error is constraint on table"

This error was before any tables were set up on the Supabase project.

These are the SQL commands I used to create an agent table and a room table after:

CREATE TABLE agents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT current_timestamp
);


CREATE TABLE rooms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  agentId UUID REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  room_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT current_timestamp
);


"what's the version you are running? you have some custom code?"

I'm literally just trying to set up the most basic agent on v2 with the most basic character file.  Haven't added any code at all.  All I want is to get an agent up and running before I start adding anything.
Maybe I should skip Supabase altogether but I just don't know how to set up a permanent database for chunks I want the agent to have access to, using the default data management system of Eliza

For V2, how would I extend plugin-bootstrap, specifically customizing provider behavior such as anxiety.
With plugin-bootstrap for example, is the agent gauranteed to use all of the providers. I remember from the only V2 dev school video, with Shaw mentioning how the agent could make its own decisions about which providers to use.

If you need to add functionality to the existing Discord plugin do you extend it in index.ts while NPXing the plugin?  Or do you bring in the entire plugin code, modify it then run  eliza like this  start --plugins=./path/to/plugin?

parseBooleanFromText is called on it, so false should turn it off
many your POST_INTERVAL_MIN is just low
because once that timer fires, it will make a post

n/m, ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION controls the loop, so MIN is not in play
however if you have POST_IMMEDIATELY on, it will make a post on start up, even if ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION is disabled
might want to consider DRY_RUN if you don't want to make posts

Can I get some help understanding how I can make this work? Im trying to add knoledge to an agent to answer about magic the gathering rules, looking in debug mode, it looks like its getting at some point some good answers like when asked

what happens if I lightning bolt a blood moon

DEBUG: [Bootstrap] *** Raw LLM Response ***

which would be correct,

but then the answer is
When you cast Lightning Bolt targeting Blood Moon, Lightning Bolt is placed on the stack.  Assuming no other actions are taken, Lightning Bolt will resolve and deal 3 damage to Blood Moon.  If Blood Moon's toughness is 3 or less, it will be destroyed as a state-based action.


Am I missing something to actualy make use of  that knowledge? this is not hitting any custom action

Hey guys,
I'm using the endpoint to send a text message to my agent, but I'm encountering an issue:
(Error) Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client.

It seems that the agent successfully builds and sends the reply message to the client, but there's still some processing happening afterward that tries to modify the headers, which causes the application to crash.

I'm currently using version 1.0.0-beta.45.

Here‚Äôs my request:

POST /api/agents/370793a4-cf80-06b1-9b3b-e05ca5a49930/message HTTP/1.1

in the character:

  settings: {
    ragKnowledge: true
  }


I tried many directory paths but it always works the same, I also tried loading it manually by loading the files and adding it with runtime.addKnowledge(), but same result

the character is at src/judgePlugin/characters/the-magic-judge.character.ts

[ai16z] <todescovitch_08219> Thats impressive, thanks you for the info! Do you think it would be possible to push this kind of agent further?

 ‚Äî 15/05/2025, 20:08
[ai16z] <kingslayer1645> It is entirely possible but currently llms hallucinate alot and they can just get stuck in loops and a turmoil of misinformation making you end up lose clients more than actually gain. Its better to use llms for context categorization and then using agentic context either call the llm to create a response or just simply play the an audio to save costs.

you need to define your plugin and few actions that first fetches information from serp api and then post tweets using our plugin-twitter

[ai16z] <todescovitch_08219> Alright, that's extremely interesting - because if we consider todays lead costs, the real question is: could running an Ai agent that calls clients randomly -without leads- in a completly non-human way, thanks to its speed and ability to make multiple calls at once, actually brings cost below that of traditional lead generation? thats the core issue here, ultimately. Also, if the AI agent has the ability not only to replace the lead, but also the teleprospector who usually calls after the lead is generated, then the cost drops even further. So the real question becomes: is the operational cost of running and maintaining the LLM higher tha those combined costs, which can easily reach thousands of euros per day for large call center-type companies? Well, you mostly answered to it, while i was writing but still really interesting improvment we could find ahead

I'm getting really depressed trying to get a simple custom agent online - been trying for weeks and v2 is just fucked.

CAN SOMEONE POINT ME TO A TUTORIAL ON MANUAL INSTALL FOR A CUSTOM CHARACTER?  Ruby the Bot gave me terrible info and the original tutorials made by Shaw no longer apply with v2.  Between the CLI, The Org, and manual install - it's a bloody mess.

PLEASE HELP.

[ai16z] <.starlord0> lowkey couldn‚Äôt find documentation either but after some digging I found that if you have a character config just place that in your root folder and on do elizaos start ‚Äîchar ‚Äú./character.json and then u can edit its plugins configs or wtv via the elizaos agent part of the CLI. I have seen some wierd bugs with my character config and i have to manually readd plugins via CLI. Dk the reason but atleast there‚Äôs a workaround

wtf is a character config?  The character info is stored in a JSON file - why all the confusing jargon?  Also, '"in my root folder"?? That makes no fucking sense - why would I store all my characters in the root folder??  v1 had a character folder - now Ruby the bot is telling me it should be in \eliza\packages\standalone\src\characters.  Which also seems stupid but maybe it's correct.  Sure isn't "just throw it in the root folder".  So tired of piecemeal advice from bots that conflicts constantly.

last update was 3 months ago and when trying to install i get

i set up supabase config in env variables but if i understand correctly i need to put it into the character file?

you can use supabase with adapter-postgres
POSTGRES_URL=your_supabase_uri
0xbisbis ‚Äî Yesterday at 23:21
https://eliza.how/packages/adapters/postgres this one? thanks for answewring btw
ElizaOS PostgreSQL Adapter | eliza

0xbbjoker ‚Äî Yesterday at 23:21
yea
0xbisbis ‚Äî Yesterday at 23:21
ok so the supabase thing is a known issue of some kind?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî Yesterday at 23:23
I know postgres is working but haven't checked supabase adapter for a while now.

adapter-postgres should handle any postgres instance, it does not matter who is the cloud service provider as long as it's postgres instance.
0xbisbis ‚Äî Yesterday at 23:23
could be i just have something wrong in my setup?
Image
tried bun just in case but neither seem to complete succesfully
gonna try some other way and see ifi can make it work
0xbbjoker ‚Äî Yesterday at 23:35
okay, do you wanna use 0.x elizaos or 1.x elizaos?

adapter you trying to use is for 0.x version.

I would suggest trying new version. It's easy to setup postgres. You don't need to install the adapter.

https://eliza.how/docs/quickstart

when you create a project you'll get the prompt to select database, go with postgres and provide the supabase connection uri.

[ai16z] <.starlord0> https://eliza.how/docs/cli/agent heres what ur lookin for. Theres no command characters as said in your error log. Also there is no import command either for the agent subcommand. so take a look at the docs to figure out whatchu need
Agent Command | eliza
Managing ElizaOS agents through the CLI - list, configure, start, stop, and update agents

0xbisbis ‚Äî 00:01
oh i see, this seems a lot simpler
has been a battle trying to set this thing up to do basic read-only on a table so far. going to try with the easy way

haha i get you, I thought starting up and using this framework would be lightwork. I feel like im learning Astrophysics or sum trying to understand and make everythign work.
0xCardiE ‚Äî 02:07
need some help,  looking from API perspective I can create agents but how do I create world and how do I get world id, also the same question for serverId?

what I want to achieve is create 5 agents, each of them in its own room (I guess group as API has only group creation), created by API and then to send messages to each of these agents?
0xbisbis ‚Äî 03:26
worked!
been going at it for a bit, managed to feed it data as rag correctly. working on some custom stuff but the base works!
trying to set up discord, the new way i am not familiar with since apparently the plugin discord isnt working
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03:32
https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/v2-develop/packages/the-org/src/communityManager/index.ts example how to setup discord ig u just miss .env and/or adding them to secrets?
0xbisbis ‚Äî 03:34
ive added to env and uncommented the plugin discord but when i launch the agent it gives me [2025-05-18 22:01:47] ERROR: Failed to load plugin @Elizaos/plugin-discord even after installation.

ahh yes
ok looking at what you sent me now, i understand what you mean by secrets and this looks like its what i am missing
going to look at it now
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03:35
also if changing the character start with elizaos dev
0xbisbis ‚Äî 03:36
ok will that leave a trail of logs or something?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03:37
for now you could pull the latest v2-develop and build CLI from it you'll have the worldId: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/v2-develop/packages/cli/src/server/api/agent.ts#L132
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 03:37
LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos dev -> to enable debug logs

thanks for the support!!

for some reason even this is not launching my bot on discord
it should directly connect right?
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 04:12
you need to create the bot, setup proper permissions and invite the bot to server
0xbisbis ‚Äî 04:13
yep so thats done, i was running it earlier through my own server
its already in a discord server + i have chatted to it earlier so it should work
0xbbjoker ‚Äî 04:14
any error logs?
0xbisbis ‚Äî 04:14
i am getting some weird opus error when trying to launch the agent from looking online i see its related to discord voice?

0xCardiE ‚Äî 04:40
ok but If I create just and Agent, there is no world so far as I need to create one first? or is there a default one when I run bun run start?
I am thinking in line that I need to create agent, then create world where he is admin, then I can lets say create 4 more agents that belong to this world and create rooms for each of them where I could talk to them. Is this correct way of thinking about this?

How to shudown all instances of eliza?
Surely there is a script for this

Is it normal for AI's to be removed from the agent list when Linux is restarted? Every time I quit and reenter, they're completely gone from my OS front-end and I have to reimport their .json's. Not even the default Eliza agent portrait gets updated. Everything seems to revert to default.
